Nice to see you.
I watched you out there I've never seen you look like that Come to that party with me.
I want you to trust me to make my own choices.

Just because you're beautiful, doesn't mean you can treat people like they don't matter.

Besides, when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power.
What's the worst?
So, I'll see you in school I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be'occupied'.
You can't just buy me a guitar every time you screw up, you know.
I'm on it Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
Nice to see you.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
''And those who are enlightened before the others are condemned to purse that light in spite of others.'There was a time when the New World didn't exist. The sun set in the west on an ocean where no man had dared to venture.

Burn gas on the freeways, and whip your sour cream of circumstance.flip at your channels and plod at your monitors. Creation is, all else is not. what is not creation is meatless sausage, and rice cake, let it all crumble to feed the artist - The artist is, all others are not, a canvas is a canvas or a painting, a rock is a rock or a statue, a sound is a sound or it is music, a preacher is a preacher or an artist - Walter passes ART, seated with two attractive women - he rolls himself a cigarette, nodding in approval to Maxwell - Where are John Joe Jake Jim Jerk, dead dead dead, they were not born before they were born, they were not born, where are Leonardo, Mozart, Shakespeare, alive alive alive, they were born - Bring on the multitudes and the multitude of fishes - feed them that you will be satisfied, nourish the artist, stretch their skin upon an easel, crush their bones into a paste, so that he may mold them, let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark - that he might take you in his magic hands and wring from your marrow wonder - all that is comes through the eye of the artist - The rest are blind fish, swimming in the cave of aloneness- swim on you mortal and muddling maddened souls - and dream, of one bright and sunny island - some artist will bait a hook, and let you bite upon it, bite hard, and die - In his stomach, you will feed creation
Probably something will enter it, feel lonely, and leave again.

Crying cockless and mussels alive, Alive O. One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was.
I was left a helpless cripple.
Suddenly I viddied what I had to do, and what I had wanted to do - and that was to do myself in, to snuff it, to blast off forever out of this wicked cruel world. One moment of pain perhaps and then sleep - forever and ever and ever.
Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep.
I bet you got little save pitiful portable picnic players.
He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong.

Dim moves over to milk machine and speaks to the statue of the nude girl.
I met your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere.
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch,'Timawrist'on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Alex finds the gang waiting for him.
Well, it's probably nothing at all, but you never know.
I had not put into any of Dim's main cables and so, with the help of a clean tashtook, the red, red kroovy stopped, and it did not take long to quieten the two wounded soldiers, down in the snug in the Duke of New York.
O bliss, bliss and heaven, oh it was gorgeousness and georgeosity made flesh. The trombones crunched redgold under my bed, and behind my gulliver the trumpets three-wise, silver- flamed and there by the door the timps rolling through my guts and out again, crunched like candy thunder. It was like a bird of rarest spun heaven metal or like silvery wine flowing in a space ship, gravity all nonsense now. As I slooshied, I knew such lovely pictures. There were veeks and ptitsas laying on the ground screaming for mercy and I was smecking all over my rot and grinding my boot into their tortured litsos and there were naked devotchkas ripped and creeching against walls and I plunging like a shlaga into them.
His hands cupped over his ears, banging his head on the floor.

Alex shushes his giggling boys and gets out of the car.
I suppose he would have called it Hanging Man.his greatest work.

I'm a fair guy, but this fuckin'heat's making me absolutely crazy. You want to know about code reds? On the record I tell you that I discourage the practice in accordance with the NIS directive. Off the record I tell you that it's an invaluable part of close infantry training, and if it happens to go on without my knowledge, so be it. I run my base how I run my base. You want to investigate me, roll the dice and take your chances. I eat breakfast 80 yards away from 4000 Cubans who are trained to kill me. So don't for one second think you're gon na come down here, flash a badge, and make me nervous.
You walk away from this now, and you have sealed their fate. Their fate was sealed the moment Santiago died.

Santiago died at one a.m. At three the doctor was unable to determine the cause of death, but two hours later he said it was poison.

I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color,y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me.

I took the entire staff down, always do this time of year. But Mrs. Sullivan didn't come. She was, had it all planned, but you know women, they change their minds. I'd been married to my Rebecca for forty-seven years and when she died, I decided I never wanted that pain again. One thing I knew about Christy: she was going to outlive me.

Look, the only idea more overused than serial killers, is multiple personality. On top of that you explore the notion that cop and criminal are really two aspects of the same person. See every cop movie ever made for other examples of this. Mom called it psychologically taut. The other thing is, there's no way to write this.
It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing.
The book's a jumping off point. No one in town can make up a crazy story like you. You're the king. I didn't want to do that this time. It's someone else's material. I have a responsibility. Anyway, I wanted to grow as a writer, do something profound and simple.

This is the story of my older brother's strange criminal behavior and disappearance. We who loved him no longer speak of Wade. It's as if he never existed. By telling his story like this, as his brother, I separate myself from his family and those who loved him. Everything of importance, that is, everything that gives rise to the telling of this story, occurred during a single deer-hunting season in a small town in upstate New Hampshire where Wade was raised and so was I. One night something changed and my relation to Wade's story was different from what it had been since childhood.

Finally she comes into view: along the silent, empty corridors, coming at last to a door with two guards standing rigid in front of it. Full armour, powerful shockrifles, expressions empty and cold.

I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly. I don't think I've done anything to sound off about. We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will? Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow. It needn't be. Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn.
May I come in?
To so many things I want to be for Bill. funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted. and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that, you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman.

From now on, we are enemies, You and Because You will not enter me, with all my need for you; because You scorn my attempts at virtue; because You choose for Your instrument a boastful, lustful, smutty infantile boy and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the Incarnation; because You are unjust, unfair, unkind, I will block You!

I was a model of virtue. I kept my hands off women, worked hours every day teaching students, many of them for free, sitting on endless committees to help poor musicians - work and work and work, that was all my life.

Wolfgang had actually summoned up his own father to accuse his son before all the world. It was terrifying and wonderful to watch. Now a madness began in me. The madness of a man splitting in half. Through my influence I saw to it Don Giovanni was played only five times in Vienna. But in secret I went to every one of those five - all alone - unable to help myself, worshipping sound I alone seemed to hear. And hour after hour, as I stood there, understanding even more clearly how that bitter old man was still possessing his poor son from beyond the grave, I began to see a way - a terrible way - I could finally triumph over God, my torturer.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything.
Majesty, I thought it the most promising work I've heard in years.
I didn't know you wrote that.

You don't take money for one reason: to buy being dishonest about everything else. And that's worse than taking money nobody gives a shit about - drug money, gambling money nobody's gon na miss. I'd rather you took it and been honest with me. Or don't take it, I don't care. But don't then go cheat on me. Don't cheat on your kid by never being around.

It's hard to choose a favorite track among so many great ones, but'The Greatest Love of All'is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about self-preservation and dignity. It's universal message crosses all boundaries, and instills one with the hope that it's not too late to better ourselves. to act kinder. Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in the world we live in to empathize with others, we can always empathize with ourselves. It's an important message, crucial, really, and it's beautifully stated on the album. Not the face, you bitch. Not the fucking face, you piece of bitch trash!
Oh my God, it even has a watermark.

David, I don't want to lose my virginity to a piece of fruit.
So my choice is either to do something hard and boring, OR to marry my. my Jew, and go to Paris and Rome and listen to jazz and read and eat good food in nice restaurants and have fun.
Oh my God.
Well, I'm not sure you'd want him to marry your sister.
I don't know.
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Now this is my idea of an ass bandit.
If he steps out of line, it would break my heart, but shoot him in the fuckin'head.
I mean, I wasn't involved, not'involved'involved, I was just trying to help him therapeutically, and some people tried to, uh, kill us.
I don't know.
This one?
I'm having nightmares as it is. Last night I dreamed we were walking down the street, I stopped to buy some fruit, and they shot me, like Brando in The Godfather.
You know, normally a patient wouldn't smoke or drink during a session.

I get enough of that at work.
He was running the family at the time.
Yeah, I do.
Look, the other day I saw a commercial on television, some kid playing with a couple of puppies. I cried for 45 minutes. Slap a pair of tits on me, I'm a woman!
Why are you wasting your time out there in the boondocks?
I got ta, you know, poop.
No, he just wanted to know you were happy. Fortunately, I am to be married.
I don't care what you do with the others but finish the girl!

Shall we cloak ourselves in silence and secrecy, as in the past? Or do we open the doors, take down the blackened curtains, and speak to our flock?
An annihilation is a cataclysmic event.
Men of God.
When you write of us, and you will write of us, may I ask one thing?

You know, andit's-it's not good for my. All right, all right, you don't wan na go to the party, so uh, whatta you wan na do? That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
You know, we had a saying, uh, that'Those who can't do, teach, and those who can't teach, teach gym.'And.uh, h'h, of course, those who couldn't do anything, I think, were assigned to our school. I must say- I always felt my schoolmates were idiots.
Goddammit!
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Okay, let me have this.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
It's time to go to scatter the ashes.
In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.
You've got good color in your cheeks.

You may count on my steel.
We are but forty men.
Honor and all.
Her face turned away from the Wisemen as it lays in the dust. Unseen by all, her bone white eyes flare open! A nasty grin forms on her face as she lies in the dust.
A bone arm rips from the grave and reaches for the Book of the Dead but Ash scoops it up first.
Why ain't you a sweet little thing?
I said the wrong thing and if I hadn't, I could be in bed now with a woman who if you could make her smile you got a life. Instead, I'm here with you, no offense, a moron pushing the last legal drug.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away.
Well, you lucky devil. It just gets better and better. I am losing my apartment and Frank wants me to promise to paint hotter subjects and to beg my parents, who haven't called, for help.
Look, there's a lot to be checked but.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell.

Stupid dog.

This is great, this is so great.
Oh, excuse me, Melvin.
You're a wonderful man. Twoo'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best. Where'd they teach you to talk like this, some Panama City'Sailor want to hump-hump bar'? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey.
I've got Jews at my table.
I think you know that.
Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
You are very certain my dog is okay. because you have no idea.
I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars.
Hey Nancy.
Why take the escalator when I could take a canoe? I haven't had fun like that since college.

There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag! They're shag-mad, man!

I'm glad.

I'm an eating, drinking, shitting, fucking Santa Claus.
Dear kid. I hope that you got my present and that there wasn't too much blood on it, although there was blood on the present you gave me which didn't keep me from enjoying it, so maybe the blood doesn't matter so much I guess. Anyway, just in case they took it as evidence I am also sending you a T-shirt. I hope it's the right size. I am healing up good and they tell me that I will soon be one hundred percent even with eight bullets dug out of me because they didn't hit any vital organs, just my liver which is fucked anyway, ha-ha-ha. Anyways. .Thank you for giving that letter to the cops. I forgot I asked you to do it but it's a good thing you did or Santa's little helper would've plugged his ass. And now the cops know I wrote it, which is gon na keep my ass out of jail. That, plus everyone agreeing that the Phoenix police department shooting an unarmed Santa was even more fucked-up than Rodney King. The cops are treating me like fucking royalty now which is new in my experience. They are gon na make me a sensitivity counselor so that tragedies like this will never again embarrass the whole fucking department. Whatever. .As for my little helper, I am sorry to have to tell you that him and his prune-faced mail-order-wife are gon na be exploring mountains with your dad. I hope your dad doesn't go sucking shit from them like I did. Meanwhile, I told the cops you had no one to take the fuck care of you, so they set it up with Mrs. Santa's sister watching you till your Dad gets back in one year and three months. They made her a Guardian Pro-Temp or some such shit. anyway, she makes better money than bartending and seems to like you and your house and Jacuzzi.
Every once in a while she gets up to play soccer with her tits! What, she's gon'rat me out? She don't know her ass from last Tuesday! You fuck her?
Huh?
Well it was on your wife's pussy last night. Why don't you dust that thing once in a while.

Fuck me. fuck me fuck me fuck me.
Watch the toenails willya?
Good night Mrs. Santa's sister. That was very nice.
It's blood from when I cut my hand when I was making it for you.
No.
Oh, you lousy fucking motherfuck. That's just the kinda shit that's gon na get us pinched!
Things are all fucked up at the North Pole. Mrs. Santa, she. she walked in on me fuckin'her sister. So I'm out on my fuckin'ass.

Listen, honey.
No one has ever tried making that work on TV.
Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service. Make Best an apology, and be off. A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.
Harry persisted in the necessity of instant departure, in which argument, as I was anxious to see the world, I must confess, I sided with him; and my mother was brought to see that, in our small house, in the midst of a village, escape would be impossible, and capture would be impossible to avoid. Roderick, my darling, my wild boy, I have forebodings that our separation is to be a long one. I spent most of all night consulting the cards regarding your fate in the duel, and all signs betoke a separation. Here is twenty guineas, all that I have in the world, and I want you to keep your father's sword and pistols, which you have known to use so like a man. She hurried my departure now, though her heart, I know, was full, and almost in half-an-hour from my arrival at home, I was once more on the road again, with the wide world, as it were, before me. No lad of seventeen is very sad who has liberty for the first time, and twenty guineas in his pocket; and I rode away, thinking, I confess, not so much of the kind of mother left alone, and of the home behind me, as of tomorrow, and all the wonders it would bring. I had no doubts of the future; thinking that a man of my person, parts, and courage, could make his way anywhere. So I rode on, singing to myself, or chatting with the passersby; and all the girls along the road said,'God save me, for a clever gentleman.'As for thoughts of Dorothy Dugan, there seemed to be a gap of a half- a-score of years.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
Well. actually, no Bill. .No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man to help somehow to ease his suffering. Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it. Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn'things up.

Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
If you don't leave her alone, I'll kill you.

I'm sure, once you get to know them, I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.
No, that's be me and me.
I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
He'll never fit!
We don't need a tall man to run this town. The bigger they are, the harder they fall. We need a. compact man who carries a big umbrella.
I don't know whether to shoot or fall in love. You poor guys.
Groping people.
God knows < u > I < /u > know. But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
Hector shakes candy into it as.
Ominous quiet again.
Who's John Wayne?
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like.
Oh God.
No one knows what caused it, but police have not ruled out the possibility of terrorists.
Huh huh huh huh huh.
Huh huh huh.
Heh heh, this is cool.
Huh huh huh.
Heh heh, this is cool.
Heh heh heh. I can't wait forever.
Heh heh, this is cool.
Mr. President, the bombers are scrambled.
Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference.
Botco International.
What's the good of being a ghost if you can't frighten people to death?
They're nice people!
Delia hates it.
Death didn't improve your sense of humor.
These people don't know the value of their property! Then we own a whole < u > town < /u > full of nowhere.
I'm getting anxious if you know what I mean. Six hundred years and all.
Is this what happens when you die? This is what happens when < u > YOU < /u > die. That is what happens when < u > HE < /u > dies. That is what happens when < u > THEY < /u > die.
They died. Ooo. Deliver me from L.L.
I would too know what to do with you.
Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head. Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
Better than your wildest dreams.
Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
You better hurry.
Yes, my dear?
Compliments of the house.
Sweetie!
My God. Only to John, sweetie.
You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me.
I don't know anything about her.
Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
Some plants do well in the sun, and others grow better in the cool of the shade. It is the gardener's responsibility to take water from the flooded area and run it to the area that is dry. It is the gardener's responsibility not to plant a sun-loving flower in the shade of a high wall. Gobbledegook! All the time he talked gobbledegook! An'it's for sure a White man's world in America, hell, I raised that boy since he was the size of a pissant an'I'll say right now he never learned to read an'write - no sir! Had no brains at all, was stuffed with rice puddin'between the ears! Shortchanged by the Lord and dumb as a jackass an'look at him now!
That is a very small room.
Before I cut your white ass!
If that don't beat all.
I will never run from another thing on this earth, you hear!
Some other way.
We met.
Look, I'll cut classes tomorrow and we'll find that Zoltar thing before you know it, okay? It's just one night.
See you in the morning.
Don't forget to call me after supper.
Hey.
So I spent the better part of three years confined to my bed, with the World Book Encyclopedia being my only means of exploration. I had made it all the way to the'G's,'hoping to find an answer to my gigantificationism, when I uncovered an article about the common goldfish.
Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power.
From that moment on, I no longer feared death.
I tell stories. You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible, everything!, I felt like such a fool to have trusted you.
There's a time when a man needs to fight, and a time when he needs to accept that his destiny is lost, that the ship has sailed, and that only a fool would continue. The truth is, I've always been a fool.
No way.
I'm going to find that girl and marry her and spend the rest of my life with her. I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
Go out with me.
That's what she does, she makes soap out of people.
I was the biggest thing Ashton had ever seen.
They say when you meet the love of your life, time stops. And that's true. What they don't tell you, is that once time starts again, it moves extra fast to catch up.
As difficult as it was to reach Spectre, I was fated to get there eventually. After all, no man can avoid reaching the end of his life. And then I realized, this wasn't the end of my life. This isn't how I die.
I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
There's a time when a man needs to fight, and a time when he needs to accept that his destiny is lost, that the ship has sailed, and that only a fool would continue. The truth is, I've always been a fool.
The best I can do is to tell it the way he told me. It doesn't always make sense, and most of it never happened.
Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion, everything but religion.
There comes a point where a reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit he's made a terrible mistake. The truth is, I was never a reasonable man. And what I recalled of Sunday School was that the more difficult something became, the more rewarding it was in the end.
There's a time when a man needs to fight, and a time when he needs to accept that his destiny is lost, that the ship has sailed, and that only a fool would continue. The truth is, I've always been a fool.
You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
So he was a giant but my grampa was going to fight him because he wasn't afraid of anything because he'd seen how he was going to die in this old lady's glass eye. That was my father's final joke I guess. A man tells his stories so many times he becomes the stories.
It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
And we have to take Glenville to avoid all the church traffic, because those damn church people drive too slow.
He just fell asleep.
If there's one thing you can say about Edward Bloom, it's that I am a social person.
Have you ever heard a joke so many times you've forgotten why it's funny? But then you hear it again and suddenly it's new.
Over the months, I learned a lot about the woman I was going to marry, but not her name, and not where to find her.
This is the uh.
I know I am.
Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
I'm grown.
Say YOU LOVE ME, NIGGA!
God saw to it to put you in my path. And I aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
Blade, myself, a few others, we've tried to keep it from spilling over onto the streets. Sometimes people like yourself get caught in the cross-fire. I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital.
Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
You're building up a resistance to the serum, Just do it, old man.
My name is Abraham Whistler.
Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die, end of story. My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
Somebody get me a goddamn wheelchair.
Vampires I fucking hate vampires.
You're hurt.
Nobody goes cold Turkey from the Thirst in a night.
They use it on heroin addicts, make'em go cold-turkey in one night. Gon na try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
It's in my blood. yelling for your tender touch, you can never get enough, cover me with your love, Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir!
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
You're our best and only friend.
It's time to die.
You better get it up or I'm going to have to kill you. Unless you're alive you can't play. And if you don't play, you don't get to be alive.
I think, therefore I am.
You go get your laser gun now.
I think, therefore I am.
I knew a cop once who was involved in a high-speed chase. They shot out one of his tires and he went over a cliff at hundred and fifty miles an hour. They found him in the morning with a broken skull, six fractured ribs and second- degree burns.
The weak link in the vampire chain of command has always been their familiars. Vampires can't go out in the day, so they get humans to do their dirty work for them Blood-running, safe house maintenance, whatever, We bleed the wanna-be vampires, they'll lead us to the real thing.
Well that's all I ever hook up with. But this betty blew'em all away in the shitstorm sweepstakes. Her name's Danica Talos. You met her earlier.
Don't you know fur is murder?
Forget it, King.
Well that's all I ever hook up with. But this betty blew'em all away in the shitstorm sweepstakes. Her name's Danica Talos. You met her earlier.
Well that's all I ever hook up with. But this betty blew'em all away in the shitstorm sweepstakes. Her name's Danica Talos. You met her earlier.
Fuck.
There's an old saying Kill one man, you're a murderer. Kill a million, a king. Kill them all, a God.
Don't you know fur is murder?
.The truth is. he was alive when I buried him.
Like to have seen his face when he found the dead end.
And remember, gentlemen, we're always here, two to two, A.M. to P.M. three hundred and sixty-four days and Christmas, God willing and the creek don't rise.
They're such wonderful dreams. The world is full of complainers. But the fact is, nothing comes with a guarantee. I don't care if you're the Pope of Rome, President of the United States, or even Man of the Year something can always go wrong.
Yeah.
Those things are nothing but coffin nails.
Well, gim me a call whenever you wan na cut off my head.
Damn.
'Cause for the next five weeks you can not wipe your own goddamn ass.'.That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love Got a job for you.
You failed because you had the wrong dream.
Shit, I'm in for life. I'm a criminal.
I thought you couldn't live without your heart.
I tried to get you furloughed, but your mother squashed it. Said it would only upset him.
I like you. very much.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.
Something is happening over there.
the night I met you. in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference.
Darling, get some glasses.
I could never eat a bug.
Hey pretty pretty.
I. I don't know.
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I'm scared.
Let's take our neighbor out.
There are some men, once they get a whiff of it, they'll trail you like a hound.
I think I've underestimated you, Ned.
If you ain't sure, don't do it.
There's nothing to tell. I lead a lonely life.
I don't like my body much. It's never been right. Sometimes, I don't know. I get so sick of everything, I'm not sure I care anymore. Do you know what I mean, Ned? I know that sometimes the shit comes down SO heavy I feel like I should wear a hat.
You can think whatever you want, Frank, but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
And the things that went on in that house. Such wild sex.
That happens.
You probably never had a heavy night in your whole, goddamn disciplined life. You know, Farmer, you're a self- righteous son-of-a-bitch. Don't laugh at me, goddamit! And don't you dare judge me.
The people who hire me don't have to be convinced to save their own lives.
The rubber-gloved hands are glueing the word'TIME'onto a message that is taking the classic form of a ransom note. Each word has been cut from a different page and is in a different typeface.
Well, go find his lazy ass.
The gangsta of love don't eat no fried chicken.
I want my life back.
Maybe once upon a time.
Sherman, I'm from the South and I'm beginning not to like this very much. leans on the hood of the car, stands up and continues her pursuit of the pimp.
Sherman?
God- fearing, church-going, never in trouble, graduating from high school, ready for college, and somebody comes along, some rich white people in a rich white man's car and wham! They run him down and never even stop.
You know I'm a sucker for a soft dick.
.You went to school, of course, but you didn't take to it much'cause you was a lot smarter than everybody else anyway.
Ain't nothing wrong with that, is there, boy?
When church is your pa affiliated with? Baptist.oh, and he thought the world of Buck, my daddy did, even knowing that Buck was serving time in jail.
I mean there's nothin'wrong with me, I don't like boys.
I coulda got killed same as everybody, and I'm wanted by the law same as everybody. Besides I coulda got snake bit sleepin'in them woods every night! I'm just a nervous wreck and that's the truth. And I have to listen to sass from Miss Bonnie Parker all the time.
I mean there's nothin'wrong with me, I don't like boys.
Only special thing about you is your peculiar ideas about lovemakin'which is no love makin'at all.
Give me a loaf of bread, a dozen eggs and a quart of milk.
And the truck drivers come in to eat greasy burgers and they kid you and you kid them back, but they're stupid and dumb, boys with big tattoos all over'em, and you don't like it.And they ask you for dates and sometimes you go.but you mostly don't, and all they ever try is to get into your pants whether you want to or not.and you go home and sit in your room and think, when and how will I ever get away from this? .And now you know. Change that. I don't like it. God, you're a knockout.
You look good, ready.
You're a seventeen year old piece of gold.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
God DAMMIT.
All part of the business.
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face. Stupid cunt!
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
When you get tired of Cagney and Lacey, come find me.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Shit.
Take another guess, take another fucking guess!
Goodbye.
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight, and fight he did. Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place!
His head was set on London bridge, where passerby were invited to jeer at the man who had caused so much fear in England. His arms and legs were sent to the four corners of Britain as warning. It did not have the effect that Longshanks planned. And I, Robert the Bruce, backed by a body of Scottish veterans, rode out to pay homage to the armies of the English king, and accept his endorsement of my crown. I hope you washed your ass this mornin, it's never been kissed by a king before.
We've orders from the king The king will be dead in a month! And his son is a weakling! Who do you think will rule this kingdom?
If I came under the sword of this murderer, I would end up like my nephew. And not you, the sight of my faggot son would only encourage an enemy to take over this country.
As bride for his son, Longshanks had chosen a relative of his rival, the king of France.
They do not even contest us! Send across the infantry.
Do that, and your men shall live.
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
They fought like warrior poets. They fought like Scotsmen.
The Almighty says this must be a fashionable fight, it's drawn the finest people.
If you break your intention, I'll kill you.
They fought like warrior poets. They fought like Scotsmen.
If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already. Your people are lucky to have a princess so kind that she can grieve at the death of a stranger. You will die! It will be awful! Every man dies. Not every man really lives. Drink this! It will dull your pain. It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me. I can't bear the thought of your torture.
Stretch him!
He broke because of me.
Do that, and your men shall live.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you.
Careful with those bloody things! Don't take any notice, love, it's their training makes them like animals.
We don't make mistakes.
All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling - In fact, killing people - - In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
I don't think they usually make mistakes.
I fixed it myself.
I don't, know.
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
Congratulations.
Sam, I think I ought to tell you. I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion. Dead?
You must trust me. I'll make you twenty years younger.
Listen.
We don't make mistakes.
I've killed you.
Be back.
I don't think they usually make mistakes.
Look you're putting me off, standing there!
Hello.
You better pray she's all right.

I've got all five senses and I slept last night, that puts me six up on the lot of you.
I gave you Jerr to see him eaten, not to see you fed.
You can't pull a play like that unless I need you for something.
I got knives in my eyes, I'm going home sick.
She called me a dirty word.
I don't know.
A hell of a thing.
No dice, soldier.
Yeah in the nice part.
Four in the morning is always the worst time for me, just before dawn, just when you've been lulled into thinking it might be safe to close your eyes for one minute.
El Toro de Oro.
I have tried to kill him and he will not die. I have a great respect for that. Don't make me take off my sunglasses.
You wonder if you've become immortal, as if you saved your own life as well. What was once criminal and happenstance suddenly makes sense. God has passed through you, why deny it, that for a moment there, God was you.
You died, you stupid bastard.
You're in luck, X: your patient awaits you with bleeding wrists on Avenue C and Fourth.
With all the poor people of this city who wanted only to live and were viciously murdered, you have the nerve to sit here waiting to die and not go through with it. You make me sick.
He's just a drunk.
He tried to kill himself.
Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last. The ghosts You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy? I think the worst is over. It can always get worse.
Come on, I've got one for you.
I have tried to kill him and he will not die. I have a great respect for that. Don't make me take off my sunglasses.
Like something's wrong with your bones, like your organs are shifting inside your body.
I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high? This conversation is not worthy of you. I'd give anything if that were true. Good night. Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive? If needy were a turn-on? Call if you get weird.
It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up, and that might not have been my choice.but it's real and it got me.and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.
They're giving me less and less air time.
God help me.
Well, you don't have to start right now. I hated the way you talked to me just now.and it wasn't just because you were right.
I've never fought for anyone before.
And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this.I grant you everything but give me this.he does personify everything you've been fighting against.And I'm in love with you.
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
Someone finds me some big towels. Five seconds. I'd go looser but we wouldn't see the graphic.
The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.
If anything happens to me tell every woman I've ever dated I was talking about them at the end. That way they'll have to reevaluate me.
We can cut back at the end. To the pan of the supplies boxes Can you believe it? I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.
I know they say those eggs can't be cracked, but if your geigers pick up more rads than you'd get off a toaster, I want you out of there.

See you've got to remember that the news room is like a cookie. That's great Evan.
You can't expect to kneel down in the middle of a highway and live to talk about it.
Never corner yourself like that. If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now. One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten. Does the world'Duhh'mean anything to you? You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
Not rude or anything.
Look, a lot's been going on.
There's got ta be a back way out of here, or something.
It's a fish.
Yeah, I felt'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
I'm babbling.
Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something. Like dealing.

This son of a bitch is throwing a two hit shutout and he's shaking me off?!
I was in the Show for 21 days, once. It was the greatest 21 days of my life. You never touch your luggage in the show, somebody else handles your bags. It's great. The ballparks are like cathedrals, the hotels all have room service, the women have long legs and brains, it's a smorgasbord.

I've watched a lot of TV in my life. I guess I've always taken it for granted. When I was a kid my mom worked nights. Never met dad.
Dost thou have a mug of ale for me and me mate? He has been pitched in battle for a fortnight an has a King's thirst for the beer thust thou might have for thust.
Hello.
Free cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac. I don't want you messing around with my life. You've caused enough trouble as it is.
Steven.
I am a smotherer. I'm just like him.
I hate that.
If we don't battle to the death, they'll kill us both.
If I leave here without understanding you, the world will always see you as a monster.

If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on?
God bless you.
I don't like disturbances in my place.
It will amuse your customers.
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat. If he gets a word in it'll be a major Italian victory.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around. As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
I thought I would never see you again, that you were out of my life.
I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers. by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars.
One woman has hurt you, and you take revenge on the rest of the world.

Congratulations, sweetheart.
And they always bypassed the alarms, or else. if not, they'd drill enough holes to knock through the walls with a sledgehammer.
No wonder the drop is off.
Yeah.
In the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing.
Frankie, some of these stones got a lot of niggers in'em.
Just another fat fuck walkin'out of the casino with a suitcase. Now, that suitcase was goin'straight to one place: right to Kansas City.which was as close to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses could go without gettin'themselves arrested. That suitcase was all the bosses ever wanted.and they wanted it every month.
I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers. by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
He knows all those guys he yelled at are friends of ours.
Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.

Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin'money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin'brain to sleep.
Look, take - walking back to the How the fuck can you grin?
Let'em complain.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone. Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gon na be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin'you. What am I doin'out here? I'm tryin'to make a livin', that's all.
Look at this fuckin'beaut they put in now. Sherbert send you in here to rob me now? Been fuckin'knockin'everybody's dick in all night?
Otherwise they're gon na make a fool out of you. They're not gon na make a fool out of me. I write it all down in this book, every fuckin'nickel that goes down.
Huh?
I'm not only legitimate, but running a casino. And that's like selling dreams for cash.
You're gon na stand here and tell me that?
If you had any fuckin'heart at all, you'd be out fuckin'stealin'for a livin'. Hit me again. What the fuck you keep lookin'at him for, huh, you fuckin'pu- Look at this, twenty fuckin'paints in a row.
Yeah, right, I'm sure.
When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves.
Don't play that thing, kid.
Frank turns to Brenda, gives her a wink.
I studied every night for two weeks.
Excuse me, earth to slut, he's taken.
Up there!
GEORGES AVENAL emerges, ducking in the blade wash.
What's your kid's name?
Pumps up to 30 liters of blood per minute.and there's only five liters in the human body.
If I give it to you.
Oh shit!
Fuck you.and the horse.you rode in on.
It's raining cats, dogs and democrats out there, so this better be worth it.
My name is Christine Collins. On March 10th, my nine year old son, Walter Collins, disappeared. A four month investigation resulted in a boy being brought to Los Angeles from De Kalb, Illinois. They told me, and all of you, that this boy was my son. They were wrong. The Los Angeles Police Department made a mistake.a terrible mistake. The boy they found is not my son. That is the reason for the supposed'transformation.'I have letters from his dentist, his teachers and others confirming that this boy is not my son. The letters are being reprinted now, and I should have them for you tomorrow. I have given the police department every opportunity to admit their mistake and renew the search for my son. Since they have refused to do so, I have no choice but to present my case before the public. I hope this will persuade the police to finish the job they started, and bring my son home to me.
We see couples walking, hand in hand, kids playing.then we notice Gordon Northcott coming around the corner.
We can take it from here.
Simply put.
Or maybe I can just ride you.
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
I hate these things, it's like drinking coffee through a veil.
Well, I guess that's it, dead end.
Hey!
It is infuriating that your unhappiness does not turn to fat! But why do you want a divorce? Because I don't love him.
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
I like that guy. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to find a quality man in Los Angeles?
Well, what're you gon na do?
I like that guy. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to find a quality man in Los Angeles? To be honest? I don't care.
Why do they always run?
That's my couch you were fucking on.
Gay or straight - ugly's still ugly. And most of those boys are scary. I thought fags were all supposed to be super-supportive of one another. Screw that'all for one'shit. I got ta deal with being the minority in the minority of the minority, and nobody's supporting my ass? While the whole of society is fawning over girls- on-girls, here I sit - a reviled gay man, and to top that off, I'm a gay black man - notoriously the most swishy of the bunch. Three strikes.
.And then Black Beauty couldn't take it any longer, and he finally did some of his own mounting.
Never take your eye off the Man. Our people took their eyes off him one time, and he had us in chains in two shakes of his snake's tail. Fight the power, little'G'. Word is bond Look at what I have to resort to for professional respect.
You don't know the half of it.
Lower your voice.
I wish you the best of luck with your book.
If you're going to get all bent out of shape while playing the game, so much so that you need to curse the t.v.
When you guys are walking in the mall and both your heads turn at a really nice looking chick, it's going to eat you up inside. You'll spend most of your time wondering when the other shoe's going to drop. Because for you, this isn't about cool weird sex stuff, it's about love.
It's like Cube says - life ain't nothing but bitches and money.
Yeah.
'Holden,'she said'The big bucks are in dick and fart jokes.'She was a church-goer. Uh-oh - the cry from the heart of a real artist trapped in commercial hell - pitying his good fortune. I'm sure you can dry your eyes on all those fat checks you rake in.
I wanted to watch some TV. Hard to do when your best friend's wrapped around a naked rug-muncher on your couch.
I mean, I've never seen that kind of thing up close and personal.
I've had my finger in my ass but I wouldn't say I've had anal sex.
Men need to believe that they're Marco fucking Polo when it comes to sex - like they're the only ones who've ever explored new territory. And it's hard not to let them believe it. I let my boys run with it for awhile - feed them some of that'I've never done this before.'bullshit, and let'em labor under the delusion that they rockin'my world, until I can't stand them anymore. Then I hit'em with the truth. It's a sick game. The world would be a better place if people would just accept that there's nothing new under the sun, and everything you can do with a person has probably been done long before you got there.
Archie was the bitch and Jughead was the butch - that's why Jughead wears that crown-looking hat all the time: he the king, of queen Archie's world. Man, I feel a hate-crime coming on He's got a point. Archie never did settle on Betty or Veronica. Because he wanted them both at the same time, you assholes! He never chose one because he was trying to get both of them into a three-way! Here. I want you to go down to the corner store and buy yourself a clue.
You fall in love with me and want a romantic relationship, nothing changes for you with the exception of feeling hunky- dorey all the time.
I just want to put you through this little exercise.
I think it's more like Banky's having a problem with all things not hetero right about now. And I'm just another paradigm of said aberration. Banky does not hate gays, you know that. But I do think he is a bit homophobic. And this latest episode between you and Ms. Thing has tapped into that.

Hey, I befriended a guy in a position of authority so I could abuse that authority and get free shit.
That's not love.

No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures. Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis'girlfriend.
All right, enough is enough.
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable.
That's a long fall.
Every night a different part. Goddam Florsheim shoe, goddammit.
You're better off not knowing.
Oh, no.
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher. I just try everything I can think of.
Those are the only terms anybody knows.
Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it. He's writing a roast like you wanted it to be - - I guess that'll show you.
He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge.
Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him. You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars. Charles, my time is too valuable for me - On the other hand - I am the publisher of the Enquirer. As such, it is my duty - I'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent, hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money - mad pirates because, God help them, they have no one to look after their interests!
I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions. That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it - But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane. He never had a conviction in his life. I guess he died without one - That must have been pretty unpleasant.
I got nothing but time.

Don't expect me to love you - You - you hit me. You'll never have another chance to hit me again.
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane. If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.
A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember.
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.
The Godfather has more eyes than a pineapple. I was saying to Manooj that if a man bows down too many times, there will come a day when he will no longer be able to stand upright.
He doesn't love you anymore.
Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true.
People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl'Mom.'I hit the lights and she freaks.
Try not to suck any more dicks on your way through the parking lot!
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer.
Damn, that's eerie.
You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
Swear you'll be in by twelve and I'll do it.Twelve.Twelve or I walk.
I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
Well, I got news for you, jerk: This store would survive without you. Without me either. All you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: You push fucking buttons.
I've spent the night on walls before, some of the best nights of my life have been spent lashed to walls Remember, keep your arms and legs in the vehicle at all times Fuck you, Jesus Christ, you think you could have put a little less effort into that climb?
He knows greatness. I'm in the presence of greatness. I want to learn about greatness. Greatness is overrated.
None of this'know ye that a prince and great man has fallen'stuff, My philosophy is simply this, Life is too short to be diplomatic. A man's friends shouldn't mind what he does or says, and those who are not his friends, well, to hell with'em. I was born in a small town in Georgia, of course. my sweet sister Florence still lives there. And I started playing baseball when I was a kid like everybody else only I was better than every- body else. When I was seventeen I started playing for money, my father didn't approve.
I'm ready.'Know ye that a prince and a great man has fallen this day.'What the hell is that? That's what Robert E. Lee said at the burial of my grandfather who was a Confederate General killed at Fredricksburg.
'Cobb, a prince among men, misunderstood in his genius, as genius always is'- This is the second line from what will be the greatest biography of a great man ever written, type it!
Stump helps Cobb to the registration desk in a clean, but very modest old hotel.
When your big bad brother Luis gets the word, your ass is freeze dried and fried.
I could use a cup of coffee.
Dear Mr. Inman.
I dragged my poor daughter to Cold Mountain from Charleston because of my Doctors, they say my heart is weak, so the air's meant to do me good. But it's the view I think heals.
I can embroider, but I can't darn, I can arrange cut flowers, but I can't grow them. If a thing has a function, if I might do something with it, it wasn't considered suitable.
I cut off my hair once, for money. My daddy got two dollars for it. Made a wig for a rich feller in Raleigh. Stobrod called himself a musician, my daddy, he could play six tune on a fiddle. Got himself shot dead at Petersburg. I was like his goat or some creature tethered to a post. He left me once, up the mountains.

The trees are an oasis of green in a world of mud between the two stark and ugly scars of the trenches.
Here I am.
Whether I see them or not, whether a man dies, or a war is won.
Play me something like there's nothing to fear from a merciful Lord.
That kiss, which I've kissed again every day of my walking. Every day of my waiting. Maybe you can't see my face, but if you could see my inside, my whatever you want to name it, my spirit, that's the fear I have deeper than any gash on my neck. I think I'm ruined. They kept trying to put me in the ground, but I wasn't ready, noma'am, no more ready than that scoundrel in there's not ready to die on us. But if I had goodness, I lost it. If I had anything tender in me I shot it dead.
I'm wetter than a fish.
That's medicine and goatmeat.
There's half the day yet. Let's make a start. My name's Ruby. I know your name. The rake: there's a rooster devil, I'm sure of it.
Your heart.
Inman turns, looks at them.
Three years I was in school before my daddy, saying God rest his soul is like wishing him what he had in life, cause he lived to rest, he was born tired, before my daddy decided there was better use for my backside than have it sat all day in front of a blackboard.
He said she was, he told me a thousand stories, she was a wolf or an indian or a donkey. Don't say much for him, except you know he'd be fast to work up a sweat on a tree if he thought there was pleasure in it. There's cows to milk. Used to be as regular as morning prayers. Matter of fact I could set my watch by my bowels.
By order of Zebulon Vance, Governor of this great state of North Carolina: any soldier turned deserter is guilty of treason and shall be hunted down like a dog.
I've learned a person can survive off pretty much of a goat. I can't abide a chicken, but a goat gives you company and milk and cheese and then, when you need it, good meat. So you've been fighting? I could be at killing for days sometimes, in the hand to hand, my feet against the feet of my enemy and I always killed him and he never killed me.
She wakes at the slightest noise. You find me some paper and a pen. OF HIS CHAPEL.
You shot or something?
Well. That was brilliant.
'Cause you are low, my brother, way low.
You've got balls bigger than Toledo. If I pull it off, it's gon na get other people killed.
You don't have the trunk space.
And blood.
You don't wan na talk, tell me to fuck off. fuck off. blood, bodily fluid and death get to you? Try deep breathing.
It's the twenty-first century.
You open that trunk, they go inside.
I'm Vincent.
'Cause you are low, my brother, way low.
I hit a deer.
This isn't the way to do things. These guys're only mouthpieces.
Y'know, I wanted to be a writer once. I wanted to write something that someday some lesser person would quote. But I never did. I'm the lesser person, Treesh. I never said anything meaningful that wasn't said by somebody else first. I am disposable. I disposed of people and I am disposable. You look cold. Chuck, what's gotten into you? You're actually acting like a gentleman.
I can't kill people. My future is in television. Listen, you're thirty-two years old and you've achieved nothing.
That's the kinda guy I am.
I am damned to hell.
Dead of a heart attack by fifty with all my millions left to you.
You're not like the other murderers.
Okay, but what you don't know is that I've brutally murdered thirty-three people for the CIA.Y'know, I came up with a new game show idea recently.

I've been shot.

Jerry, there's something I have to ask you. Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis. Sure. And the two of'em used my legs for a wishbone. Nearly snapped me in half. I got ta go, Flip.
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
I was wrong! I was wrong!
None of it ever proven.
If you could remember who shot you and where it happened, it might help.
See?
You're going to die because you smoked 30 cigarettes a day since you were 15. And you're going to Hell because of the life you took.
You sure about that?
You're going to die because you smoked 30 cigarettes a day since you were 15. And you're going to Hell because of the life you took.
John is healed.
Another rat scoots past.
Something more personal.
The ambulance moves through a city that is transforming. From this world's Los Angeles to a barren Hell version. Officially I was dead for seven minutes. But believe me, seven minutes in Hell is a lifetime.
So.
Vamos juntos a matarla.
The entire mess collapses to the ground in a flood of scattering critters.
Mammon's form ripples through her, starts to push out through her skin.
Ellie. this life doesn't last forever.
Happy New Year, little lady.
Happy New Year, little lady.
I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out, to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal.
Don't get me wrong, we're smart, Larry. We shop at home, we surf the net. and we feel emptier and lonelier and more cut off from each other than at any other time in human history.Y'know who'd make great astronomers? Vampires. Think about it; the perfect synthesis of career and lifestyle.
This isn't about them, it's about us, our violence, our fear and mistrust, Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion. But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.Y'know what?
But right now my job is to protect American lives from any plausible threat, and in that regard I have to assume the worst.
Those are numbers, each pulse is a set, break it down 79, 83, 91, they're all primes, no way that's a natural phenomenon,!
You don't believe it to be.
Grins like a baby and bites like a'gator.
You run one time, you got yourself a set of chains.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with. Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on'em. Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain.
I'm takin'
One in the box and one in the bush.
They're reasonable, Luke.
I hope you ain't gon na be a hardcase.
Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
A bull I fell off.
You're just like them.
Don't forget about me, guys.
Thou art alive.
The Beldam!
You may come out when you've learned to be a loving daughter!
You're the jerk-wad that gave me the doll!
Yeah, I wan na hugga your face! Get a grip, soldier.
Make you strong.
Good night, Coraline.
She's a peach, she's a doll, she's a pal of mine. She's as cute as a button in the eyes of everyone who ever laid their eyes on Cor- a-line. When she comes around exploring Mom and I will never ever make it boring our eyes will be on Coraline.
There's just one tiny little thing we have to do.
Real Mom!
Well.
You may come out when you've learned to be a loving daughter!
I want to be with my real mom and dad.
I don't like rats at the best of times, but this one was sounding an alarm.
I, I've got ta hide this somewhere, s- somewhere she can never.
