People spend their whole lives debating: we fight about who's right and who's wrong, we fight ourselves, we fight each other, we fight death, we fight over beliefs, we fight over fights.

I'm even guilty of it myself, the way I go on about Christ's ethnicity, fighting for the truth to come out. And I'm dead. Even in death, the only way I know how to live is through debate.

People I Who cares about this stupid election? We all know it doesn't matter who gets elected president of Millard. You think it's going to change anything around here, make one single person happier or smarter or nicer? The only person it matters to is the one who gets elected. The same pathetic charade happens every year, and everyone makes the same pathetic promises just so they can put it on their transcripts to get into college. So vote for me, because I don't even want to go to college, and I don't care, and as president I won't do anything. The only promise I make is that if elected I will immediately dismantle the student government, so that none of us will ever have to sit through one of these stupid assemblies again!
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake. I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences. You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact, but maybe one day you'll understand. I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay. I agree. But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections. And I think certain older persons like you and your'colleague'shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant. And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits.

Hey, Brain, I could use some gas if you can spare some. I'm glad you remember me.
I can't hear you. Get me the diagram.
I'm going to inject you.
Who cares.
Because I loathe and detest bananas.
I would like that.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
You don't trust me.
Well, sure, I'll just.
We're getting healthy read-outs.
Don't be like me, son.
Well
And I'm happy.

Oh
Beyond
I loved you so much this day.
I never saw you together like that again.
But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper.
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling. A born freak can only go uphill. Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean. I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out.
Everything green on my boards, Skipper. Start the countdown.
I am home.
Dead bodies in the cellar, dead bodies in the cellar.
An an.ha-ha-ha-ha-ha- that's the stupidest thing I ever heard in my life.
I'm all right. Come unlock this chain and let me out.
You-
You have pretty skin- give it to us!
Don't you recognize me?
I don't want to die.
Jesus, I can't feel my legs.
Now
My father is dead.
Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day.
I loved you, mighty child.
You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind. They are only for you, for in them I mixed things that heal, but not too quickly; and things that make limbs sleepy, preventing escape, but keep one's mind sharp.
My knights have fought my causes.
I do feel the urge to kill someone here.
Look - this one's got a cavity. That thing was designed to get past any kind of metal or synthetics detector. It's all flesh and bone.
We now see Levi's audience, about seventy-five people, some standing, some sitting on plastic folding chairs. They are of very mixed age and type, but they all cheer and applaud enthusiastically. We are in the central playing area of a small, deconsecrated country church, and Levi performs on a broad, low, carpeted plywood dais. At the far end of the dais, a man and a woman - assistants to Levi - are carefully laying out about two dozen plastic modules that look somewhat like high-tech ski boots. My name is Wittold Levi, my friends call me Witt - and I'm the project manager for eXistenZ.
I went into the'Warrants'system and erased your records.

Yeah, I have that effect on people.
You wan na explain that?!
My competitors?
You don't know the meaning of the word.

Let's see if we can get blood from a stone.
You want me to lift some weights or something?

Welcome back. This is going to be fun.
A few fans.
You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
The snarling beagle barks and snaps below them.
And I've got thirty-seven. That's 108 men altogether.
I love you, too, but I shouldn't have married you.
I don't want to be put in the middle of this.

Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People. Yeah. Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once. Probably good advice, if you have shit for brains. There he goes, one of God's own prototypes, a high powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live and too rare to die. We are all wired into a survival trip now. No more of the speed that fueled that 60's. That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip. He crashed around America selling'consciousness expansion'without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait for all the people who took him seriously. All those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy Peace and Understanding for three bucks a hit. But their loss and failure is ours too.
Come back and have a beer!
Dr. Bloomquist, do you think the anthropologist, Margaret Mead's strange behavior of late might possibly be explained by a private marijuana addiction? I really don't know, but at her age, if she did smoke grass, she'd have one hell of a trip! I know a hell of a lot better ways to waste my time than listening to this bullshit.
That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him.
The name rang a bell, but I couldn't concentrate. Terrible things were happening all around us. Order some golf shoes. Otherwise, we'll never get out of this place alive. It's impossible to walk in this muck, no footing at all. I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds! If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.

It was time.
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot. One of the things you learn, after years of dealing with drug people, is that you can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug.

I wouldn't fault anybody for doing that.
A family member dies and you insult me.
There's a railroad strike.

What's so dangerous about a character like Ferris Bueller is that he gives the good kids bad ideas. The last thing I need at this point in my career is fifteen hundred Ferris Bueller disciples running around these halls.
My name is Bueller. It's real nice that you hope my brother's feeling better but I'm in danger, okay? I'm very cute, I'm very alone and I'm very protective of my body. I'd rather not have it violated or killed. I need help! Excuse me. If whoever's in the house is still in the house, I'd like you to know that I have just called the police. If you have any brains whatsoever, you'll get your ass out of my house real quick. I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun. And a scorching case of herpes.

Screw Walter. His candy-ass wouldn't last a second Wednesday night.

You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need. No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled.
You will see tiny figures pounding corn and laying-strips of venison on the empty car pool lane of the ruins of a superhighway.
Had I been going to bed earlier every night?
Losing all hope was freedom.

Maybe I died already.
When you have insomnia, you're never really asleep and you're never really awake. I hadn't slept in four days. But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive. They never said'parasite;'they said'agent.'They always talked about getting better.
The lye combined with the melted fat of the bodies, till a thick white soapy discharge crept into the river. The first soap was made from the ashes of heroes. Like the first monkeys shot into space. Without sacrifice, without death, we would have nothing. This is a chemical burn. It will hurt more than you've ever been burned and you will have a scar. Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand.
Losing all hope was freedom.
I'm a recall coordinator. My job is to apply the formula.
The third rule of fight club is, when someone says'stop'or goes limp, the fight is over. Fourth rule is, only two guys to a fight. Fifth rule, one fight at a time. Sixth rule, no shirts, no shoes. Seventh rule, fights go on as long as they have to. And the eighth and final rule, if this is your first night at fight club, you have to fight. This kid, Ricky, supply clerk, couldn't remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black ink.
This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
Every time the plane banked too sharply on take-off or landing, I prayed for a crash, or a mid-air collision, anything. No more haircuts. Nothing matters, not even bad breath. Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip. There are three ways to make napalm. One, mix equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice.
The ability to let that which does not matter truly slide.
Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call. In the meantime, don't leave town.
You're a genius, sir. You know the drill. You said if anyone ever tries to interfere with Project Mayhem, even you, we got to get his balls.
Tyler was a night person.
Robert Paulson is dead. He's dead, because of you. I understand. In death, a member of Project Mayhem has a name.
It's not my problem.
I was lost in oblivion, dark and silent and complete.
You're a step closer to hitting bottom.
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.

I don't want to die without any scars.

Might've been too much.
If I didn't say anything, people assumed the worst. They cried harder. I cried harder. Tonight, we're going to open the green door, the heart chakra. I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
You could be beautiful, rich and famous.
You cry now.

you met me at a very strange time in my life.
This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room.

The people who had power over you have less and less. By this point, I could wiggle most of the teeth in my jaw. A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough. After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.

Well, there you are! You are the first people to see the lost GALAXY QUEST episode 52 two parter since it was originally aired in'82! As most of you know, no concluding episode was filmed when the series was cancelled, so one episode was never included in the syndication run.
'The Quasar Dilemma', you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies? It's a television show.
So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.'

Kill something! Fuck it. Blow me.
This is for you, you dumb bitch. I hope you do the right thing with it.
When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time they can seem invincible. But in the end they always fall. Think of it, always. When you are in doubt that that is God's way, the way the world is meant to be. think of that.
When I get the chance.
I hope it will not stand between us as men.
After what they did at the massacre, it's only an eye for an eye. An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.
But I don't know why either should be interested in an old man sitting in prison when the world is blowing itself to pieces. You're the only man I know who makes his own clothes. Ah, but for me that's not much of an accomplishment.
You must understand, gentlemen, that His Majesty's Government, and the British people, repudiate both the massacre and the philosophy that prompted it. What I would like to do is to come to some compromise over the new civil legis, If you will excuse me, Your Excellency, it is our view that matters have gone beyond'legislation.'We think it is time you recognized that you are masters in someone else's home. Despite the best intentions of the best of you, you must, in the nature of things, humiliate us to control us.
If I'm taken, Maulana is to lead the march.
There are unjust laws, as there are unjust men. You're a very small minority to take on the Government, and the Empire. If you are a minority of one, the truth is the truth.

Oh Jesus, no. The appearance of law must be upheld, especially while it's being broken.

You know, I feel like an omelette. You think I could have a cheese omelette with shallots, but with the shallots only slightly browned. I think the romance angle in your story is critically important, that isn't simply a jump in the sack for either of them.

Whisper to them in their sleep that I live only to hold them again and all else is dust and air. Ancestors, true bloodline, I honor you and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me. I search the faces of the Gods for ways to please you. to make you proud. and I can never do it. One kind word, one full hug where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight, would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years.

If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you.
Mr.
You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you. I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home. When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there.
His medical condition is reported as. & quot; terminal. & quot; He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
I know it wasn't me.so that leaves you. There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know. We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street. Things were good and we made the most of it. During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too. I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town. Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order. When I heard about it I wasn't angry. I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things. So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business. There's three million dollars on that table. I'm going to lie down, maybe take a nap.
You know, when I was a kid, I did this amazing thing. I went out on a fishing trip; me and my brothers and my Pop, and no one could catch a fish except me. And this was my secret: Every time I would put the line down I would say a & quot; Hail Mary & quot; and every time I said a & quot; Hail Mary & quot; I would catch a fish.

That you were forced to retire because, uh, a sex scandal. A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks. You're a dirty old man.
Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion? There's no people like you in my crowd.
The bells of hell go ting-a-ling For you but not for me.
More so now that I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.

There's no Ranger game on tonight.
Somebody make up your mind! Take central park!

The good news is they got the message. The bad news is we've got five and a half minutes to get out of the building.
I don't know what your reputation is, but after the shit you tried to pull today, you can bet I'll be looking into it. Any conversations you want to have with me heretofore, you can have with my attorney. Gentlemen, keep your ears to the grindstone.
Hey, how's it goin'?
Well, let's get started.
You've never been on a plane. I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person.
You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin'next door to me, comin'over watchin'the fuckin'Patriots'games and still workin'construction, I'll fuckin'kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact.
Little things I do out of habit. People call these things imperfections Will. It's just who we are. And we get to choose who we're going to let into out weird little worlds. You're not perfect. And let me save you the suspense, this girl you met isn't either. The question is, whether or not you're perfect for each other. You can know everything in the world, but the only way you're findin'that one out is by giving it a shot. You sure won't get the answer from an old fucker like me. And even if I did know, I wouldn't tell you. Why not? You told me every other fuckin'thing. You talk more than any shrink I ever met. I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it. You ever think about gettin'remarried? My wife's dead.
I've been sitting over there for forty-five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me.
You're a pretty funny guy.
Do you think you're alone?
Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a'shrink kit'that comes with all these volumes included?

When they found Sepe in the meat truck, he was frozen so stiff it took them two days to thaw him out for the autopsy.
When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy. I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband, Are you nuts? Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car. Listen, we're beginning to make real money for the first time. It's business. Do you think I'm going to walk away from that? After a while, it all got to be normal. None of it seemed like crimes. It was more that Henry was enterprising. That he and the guys were making a few bucks hustling, while other men were sitting on their asses waiting for handouts. Our husbands weren't brain surgeons. They were blue collar guys, and the only way they could get extra money, real extra money, was to go out and cut a few corners.
I didn't say a thing.
We had friends and relatives who worked all over the place and they tipped as off about what was coming in and what was going out. If any of the truckers or airlines gave as trouble, Paulie had his people scare then with a little strike. It was beautiful. It was an even bigger money-major than numbers, and Jimmy was in charge.
Tuddy Vario ran the cabstand and a pizzeria and a few other places for his brother, Paul, who was the boss over everybody in the neighborhood. Paulie might have moved slow, but it was only because he didn't have to move for anybody. At first, my parents loved that I found a job across the street. My father, who was Irish, was sent to work at the age of eleven, and he liked that I got myself a job.
The first time I was introduced to them all at once, it was crazy. Paulie and his brothers had lots of sons and nephews and almost all of them were named Peter or Paul.

We'll go in through the woods. I was sitting in my house on prom night wearing that Goddamned rented tuxedo, a corsage in one hand, a bottle of champagne in the other. So I was just sitting there, and then the whole night flashed before my eyes, and it struck me like a bullet in the head I realized, finally, and for the first time, that. I wanted to kill somebody. So I figured because I loved you so much, that'd it'd be a good idea if I didn't see you anymore.

I'm feeling kind of superior tonight. Seven high schools in seven states and the only thing different was my locker combination. We've broke through the peer pressure cooker.

Let's get a Slurpee.'And she's buying the stairway to heaven.'I'm not belittling the Famine Fund Peter, but we're talking teen suicide! Westerburg finally got one and I'm not going to blow it.
I'm sure your friends are happy to hear that.

It all started right here in Queens, Jim, at World of Donuts about one year ago today, when local garbage man, Simon Grim, put pencil to paper and began to compose what many have come to regard as vicious, antisocial and pornographic poetry, 112 lines of unrhymed free meter verse which would one day serve to spark the flames of controversy across the nation and, indeed, the world.

Dear Mr Grim, we here at the magazine consider ourselves and the publication open-minded and cutting edge and have consistently printed the work of the most brilliant and farseeing young talent of the day. Every week we are forced to return writing which we can not for one reason or another publish and include a brief but polite refusal.

Alison Ashworth. My relationship with Alison Ashworth lasted six hours. The two hours after school and before The Rockford Files, three days in a row. On the fourth afternoon. Kevin Bannister. It would be nice to think that since I was fourteen, times have changed, relationships have become more sophisticated, females less cruel, skins thicker, but there still seems to be an element of that afternoon in everything that has happened to me since. All my other romantic stories seem to be a scrambled version of that first one. Number two.

I start to remember things now: His stupid clothing, his music, Latin, Bulgarian, whatever fucking world music was trendy that week stupid laugh, awful cooking smells. I can't remember anything good about him at all. I never liked him much then, and I fucking hate him now. I manage to block out the worst, most painful, most disturbing memory of him until I go to bed. Jeez. He goes on long enough. I should be so lucky. You are as abandoned and as noisy as any character in a porn film, Laura. You are Ian's plaything, responding to his touch with shrieks of orgasmic delight. No woman in the history of the world is having better sex than the sex you are having with Ian in my head.

The Zippleback eyes them ravenously. What does that make us? The dragons BANK and dive in formation, plummeting through the thickening fog and weaving between towering, craggy sea stacks. They emerge at the base of a massive volcanic caldera, glowing with rivulets of lava. The flock of dragons fall into rank, funneling through a crack, and zipping through a winding tunnel. It gives way to a vast, steamy inner chamber, tiered with pocky shelves. Dragons of all breeds lay about, nested in hordes. The arriving dragons fly in, dropping the fish and game into a central pit, glowing red and shrouded in mist.

He had been committed the previous year after applying one too many times at our local zoo for the job of'apprentice ape.'My father saw what the human race had come to while he was. in captivity. He felt something had to be done to create a better world. He stole little me from my mother, his ex-wife, and raised me, with love and tenderness and respect, as an ape like himself. Apes don't assassinate their presidents, gentlemen. Until quite recently I believed myself to be an ape, although I didn't know specifically what type. Apes don't think in terms of type. It might be argued, gentlemen, that apes don't even know that they are apes. In retrospect, however, I'd say that I was a pygmy chimp. I have to say I always hated apes.

I know I'm failing you, I know I'm disappointing you, I know you deserve better but get in the fucking car! It's like every morning I wake up and fail, and I look around and anybody, anybody can pull it off, but somehow I can't. And I know, I know I have everything, and I'm still miserable and it's pathetic. I know it's pathetic. No matter how hard I try, something about me will never be enough. You're enough.

And the reason for this, is because our little foe has a instinct for survival and presavation second to none. And that Monsieur, is what a jew shares with a rat. Consequently, a German soldier, conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding jews. Where does the hawk look? He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar - he looks everywhere, he would hide. But there are many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide. However the reason the Fuhrer brought me off my Alps in Austria, and placed me in French cow country today, is because it does occur to me. Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.

Dear Louis. will I ever forget? Adapted by Neil Jordan From the novel by Anne Rice A small bare room, illuminated only by the streetlight coming through the window. So you want me to tell you the story of my life.
Merciful Death how you love your precious guilt. For years I had not savoured a human. And when I had Lestat's words made sense to me. I knew peace only when I killed and when I heard her heart in that terrible rhythm I knew again what peace could be. Yet even then I could not contenance it. All I need to find you Louis is follow the corpses of rats. Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire.
You've let your estate rot. You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
You're body's dying.
For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.

Then God does not exist. I have not spoken to him. And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil? None that I've ever known. I know nothing of God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world.
And I will suffer for it no longer!
