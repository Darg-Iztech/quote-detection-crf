I adore you!
In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons.
If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection. then it won't end like this. You need me.
Do you think so?

The place was dark as we left, a darkness that confounded even Claudia. And as we blundered through it, again came the thought: I have wronged Lestat, I have hated him for th wrong reasons.
Merciful Death how you love your precious guilt. For years I had not savoured a human. And when I had Lestat's words made sense to me. I knew peace only when I killed and when I heard her heart in that terrible rhythm I knew again what peace could be. Yet even then I could not contenance it. All I need to find you Louis is follow the corpses of rats. Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
You think you can go back.
There was sadness there, rich, almost sweet, like the fragrance of jasmine. I walked the streets, savouring it like a long lost perfume. And then on Prytania Street, only blocks from the Lafayette cemetery I caught the scent of death and it wasn't coming from the graves. The scent grew stronger as I walked. Old death. A scent too faint for mortals to detect. They were like the doomed princess caught in the thorny vines of Sleeping Beauty's castle.

Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
Can I touch your breasts?
Remember that time I got my dick caught in my zipper? You know, when I was in first grade.
Doug, you do understand that you may be the only person at this party with artificial sideburns?
And I didn't pick my father. And if I had a choice between having tons of money or having another father, I'd be absolutely delighted to be poor! But unfortunately life is not a cafeteria!
Yeah. Back yard nudity is hypocritical. It's insincere. People should do and say exactly what they feel or think and not try to hide things.
You didn't know your mother at all if you think someone like me would've ever stood a chance with someone like her. That just goes to show you how stupid this town is, that they'd believe she slept with me.
I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York. Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money.
Just a little gag of mine.
There must be some easier way for me to get my wings.
That's a Christmas present from a very dear friend of mine.

This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter.

Then I'm gon na shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin'in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
And I've been waitin'on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I got ta start all over again, but I got nothin to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell. Come in. Great, you're here.

Suddenly I was my father's son. I was remembering the simple pleasures of this job, how I ended up here out of law school, the way a stadium sounds when one of my players performs well on the field. I was remembering even the words of the late Dicky Fox, the original sports agent, who said: The key to this job is personal relationships. And suddenly it was all pretty clear. The answer was fewer clients. Caring for them, caring for ourselves, and the games too. Starting our lives, really. We must embrace what is still virginal about our own enthusiasm, we must crack open the tightly clenched fist and give back a little for the common good, we must simply be the best versions of ourselves. that goodness will be unbeatable and the money will appear. Hey, I'll be the first to admit it.
What I was writing was somewhat'touchy feely.'I didn't care. I had lost the ability to bullshit. It was the me I'd always wanted to be. I printed it up in the middle of the night, before I could re-think it. That's how you become great, man. You hang your ba11s out there.

I don't know. but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you. I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you. I missed my wife. We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh, I love you.

Triangulation of crossfire is the key. You get the diversionary shot gets the Secret Service looking one way - Boom! You get the kill shot.

There were two other men on the eastern end of the parking lot. Each of'me had uniforms. At the time of the shooting there seemed to be some commotion.

The Official Legend is created and the media takes it from there. The glitter of official lies and the epic splendor of the thought-numbing funeral of J.F.K. confuse the eye and confound the understanding. Hitler always said'the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it.'Lee Oswald - a crazed, lonely man who wanted attention and got it by killing a President, was only the first in a long line of patsies. In later years Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, men whose commitment to change and to peace would make them dangerous to men who are committed to war, would follow, also killed by such'lonely, crazed men,'who remove our guilt by making murder a meaningless act of a loner. We have all become Hamlets in our country - children of a slain father - leader whose killers still possess the throne. The ghost of John F. Kennedy confronts us with the secret murder at the heart of the American dream. He forces on us the appalling questions: Of what is our Constitution made? What is our citizenship, and more, our lives worth? What is the future of a democracy where a President can be assassinated under conspicuously suspicious circumstances while the machinery of legal action scarcely trembles?

There's not a doubt in my mind that through all my anger.my ego, I was faithful in my love for you. From seventh grade on. That I made you doubt it, that I withheld it.that's the greatest mistake of a life full of mistakes. But the truth doesn't set us free, Robin. I can say it as many times as you can stand to hear it.

Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order! No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold. Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France! He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself. How can I serve you in this? Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private? If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel. I will kill both him and the man who told me. Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?
All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal. See, Porthos, secrets are hard to keep. We don't have much time.

I'm going to do my upmost I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with? I say fall head over heels. Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back. And how do you find him? Forget your head and listen to your heart. I'm not hearing any heart. Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back. Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this. To make the journey and not fall deeply in love, well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try. Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.

I have problems with my stomach and my leg muscles feel very weak. My gums seem to be shrinking and they sometimes bleed when I massage them.
And I've been playing it cool and I've been good and now I'm damn tired of being good cause you people gave me the belief that I had 53 days left. You hung 53 days in front of my eyes and then you took those 53 days away, and Mister Prosecutor! I just wish you could. stand right here where I'm standing and feel what that. feels like, cause then you'd know something you don't know you'd know what means, Mister Prosecutor and you'd know the concept of a society is based on the quality of its mercy means, of its sense of fair play, its sense of justice. but I guess that's just like asking a bear to shit in a toilet.

I don't know how I would have gotten through it without all of you. I really think it is a testament to the love in this institution, that I stand before you today, as the first straight'C'student in school history voted Valedictorian. Again, to Marvin Tepperman, the real valedictorian, he deserved this and I want to wish him a speedy recovery. I spoke to his doctors today and they say, with medication and therapy, Marvin should be able to attend Harvard this fall. While I may not have excelled in the classroom, I think my recent experiences in that bigger schoolhouse we call'life', have taught me a few lessons that I'd like to share with my fellow graduates. Follow your heart and don't question it, now matter where it tells you to go. Trust me, it'll open up a world of new experiences you can't even imagine. But as you listen to it, don't forget your family, your parents. Don't forget they're people too, and while we may not always agree with them, remember to love them when they need love. And I mean really love them, don't just pay them lip service.

Thank God you didn't show up any later. This place gives me the chills at night. No electricity, and all these mirrors. You know, I live in Brooklyn near a Jewish neighborhood, and when someone dies, they cover all the mirrors in their house.

Believe it or not, there's always a bit of truth in any superstition.

I'd just like to say that if there are many more back home like you, God help anyone who goes to war with America. Please be seated, gentlemen. Churchill and Stalin are asking me what I'm asking you: How long is America going to pretend the world is not at war?

There are times since I have felt like the child born of those two fathers. but be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life.

It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses. You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
, I'm gon na kill him.
Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gon na shoot.
Well, he's either dead or he's alive or the cops got him or they don't.
Look, Vic, whatever you wan na do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew. No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
Mr.
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that? I don't wan na kill anybody. But if I got ta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin outta my way. That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin ten years, and takin out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all.
