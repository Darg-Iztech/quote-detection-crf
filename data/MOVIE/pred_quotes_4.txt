Mr.
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that? I don't wan na kill anybody. But if I got ta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin outta my way. That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin ten years, and takin out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin? You can't work with a guy like that. That mother- fucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger- happy? I think he's a sick fuckin maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place.
For years I thought we shared a secret.that we would be wonderful in the world.
All I know is what I feel. And anyone else in their right mind would feel the same way.
Maybe I'll take you with me.
Well, I guess this wasn't what you had in mind when you went to work this morning?
And Frank, in all sincerity, if you do decide to join us, I believe it'll be a thing you'll never regret.
I'm not happy about it.
Jesus, don't make me laugh!
Maybe we are just as crazy as he is. If being crazy means living life as if it matters then I don't care if we are completely insane. Do you?
?
You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending, trapped in his ridiculous castle, still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood I don't want you to There is nothing to understand but this: I am a man who could have been great, but was not.
Well I'll be g-g-goddamned if he's not springing all the traps and leaving cheese for the rats!
Farewell, friend.
I took the bread. That's not true. They're not interested in truth. You are too weak, Peter. You would not live through it. Sacrifice for the weaker? How noble. As you wish. Cut off this one's hand as well!.

No, .Mr Cole. Think before you drink and before you drive me mad Bandy. Don't worry boys, nothing to be nervous about, some of my Dad's best friends ended up here.

No, I don't belong here.

Romeo
I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison yet doth hang on To make me die with a restorative. Thy lips are warm. Thus with a kiss I die.
Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man.
Thou, wretched boy, shalt with him hence. Either thou or I, or both, must go with him. Either thou or I, or both, must go with him. Why the devil came you between us?
I hate the word As I hate hell, all Montagues, and.
Let me have A dram of poison, such soon- speeding gear As will disperse itself through all the veins That the life-weary taker may fall dead. Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law Is death to any he that utters them. The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law. Then be not poor, but break it and take this. My poverty, but not my will consents.
For Ine'er saw true beauty till this night.
A bespectacled eye peers through the crack of a partly open doorway.
O Nurse, how shall this be prevented? What sayest thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort, Nurse. Faith, here it is. I think it best you married with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman! I think you are happy in this second match, For it excels your first; or if it did not, Your first is dead - or'twere as good he were As living here and you no use of him. Speakest thou from thy heart?
O true apothecary, thy drugs are quick.
'T is true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall.
Saint Francis be my speed tonight!
The Nurse and Juliet reach the door, but instead of leaving, they turn and ascend the staircase that arcs around to the mezzanine level.
Brilliant sparkles light in her eyes. We hear her secret whisper: My only love, sprung from my only hate. Too early seen unknown, and known too late. Prodigious birth of love it is to me JULIET'S P.O.V.: In slow motion Romeo, through the falling curtain of fiery embers.
Thou art a villain!
Abra shrieks: Four hands reaching for guns.
I would the fool were married to her grave!
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them if they bear it.
A sea of black umbrellas stretches back from the steps of Freedom Tower. See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love; And I, for winking at your discords too, Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished. The rain falls. Two black cars lead the people of Verona Beach in a sorrowful parade. A TV anchor woman watches the image on a studio monitor. A glooming peace this morning with it brings: The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
Though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He's not the flower of courtesy, but I'll warrant him as gentle as a lamb.
Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground!
I lone to die!
When I have fought with the men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with That thou her maid art far more fair than she. Be not her maid, since she is envious. Her vestal livery is but sick and green, And none but fools do wear it.
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them if they bear it.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man.
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy. Away, begone; the sport is at the best. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest. My only love sprung from my only hate! Too early seen unknown, and known too late! Prodigious birth of love it is to me, That I must love a loathed enemy. I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall Now seeming sweet convert to bitterous gall.
I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords.
And I, for winking at your discords too, have lost a brace of kinsman. All are Punished. ALL ARE PUNISHED! A glooming peace this morning with it brings, the sun, for sorrow will not show his head. Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardoned and some punished. For never was a story of more woe, than this of Juliet and her Romeo. May 20, 1997 God loves me.
O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
And I, for winking at your discords too, have lost a brace of kinsman. All are Punished. ALL ARE PUNISHED! A glooming peace this morning with it brings, the sun, for sorrow will not show his head. Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardoned and some punished. For never was a story of more woe, than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

What happens next happens very fast. She strides silently to the first table, two men drinking quietly, and she slams her foot into one's face, then whips it back into the other's, knocking them both unconscious as, people are turning, just registering that this girl, kicks the table into a card player even as she sweeps a bottle off it behind her, the bottle hits a man behind her square in the face, a man she never even looked at, people are rising, fleeing or pushing forward, River.

As he talks, two shadows slip quietly out the door behind him. This isn't an easy decision for me, Mr. Remmington. For my family, racing is everything. We eat, drink, think and breathe racing. There is nothing more perfect than a picnic at Thunderhead. I mean, I was taught to drive before I could walk. But when my brother died, all that went away. I can't tell you how painful that was. It nearly killed all of us. Especially Pops. He didn't set foot in his shop for over a year. As the memory comes to life, we see the images in flashback. But one night when I was still pretty young. I couldn't sleep and I went into the living room and there was Pops, in his beat up robe, watching some old race recordings. The blue tv light of Speed's memory fills his eyes. So I sat with him watching of Ben Burns coming round the last turn of he'43 Prix and all of a sudden Pops started screaming, and then I started screaming, and as Burns and Dugazi duked it out, heading for the finish, we were cheering our heads off and the second the black and white came down, we looked at each other and right there we realized the naked truth; racing is in our blood.

For the last time, gentlemen, let me remind you: any prisoners found outside the barracks after lights out will be shot on sight. Furthermore, the iron stove in Barrack 4, the one camouflaging the trap door, will be removed. And so that the men from this barrack will not suffer from the cold, they will keep warm by filling in the escape tunnel. Is that clear? All right, then, gentlemen. We are all friends again.

You want to hear about the busted light socket in the bathroom, or the carbon monoxide in the garage? No. I may be old fashioned, but I thought murder was against the law. But not against the law of nature. My theory is that everybody is a potential murderer. Didn't you ever want to kill somebody? Say one of those useless fellows Miriam was running around with? You can't go around killing people just because you think they're useless.
I have a murder on my conscience, but it's not my murder, Mr. Haines, it's yours. And as you're the one to profit, I think you should be the one to pay for it.

And
You don't talk to people. It's not, Okay, folks, let's run it! The scene comes alive with specific activity: weeping Hazel, a little boy in the back playing with dirt clods, a man and a woman eyeing each other flirtatiously from a distance, an old woman with Parkinson's fiddling with Rosary beads, a well- dressed woman squatting and peeing near a gravesite. A minister addresses the mourners. Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for twenty years. And you'll never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say there is no fate, but there is: it's what you create. Even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes or it seems to but doesn't really. And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope for something good to come along. Something to make you feel connected, to make you feel whole, to make you feel loved. And the truth is I'm so angry and the truth is I'm so fucking sad, and the truth is I've been so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long have been pretending I'm ok, just to get along, just for, I don't know why, maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery, because they have their own, and their own is too overwhelming to allow them to listen to or care about mine.

Sydney Wade? When she called.
He is interested in two things and two things only: Making you afraid of it and telling you who's to blame for it. That, ladies and gentlemen, is how you win elections. You gather a group of middle-aged, middle-class, middle- income voters who remember with longing an easier time, and you talk to them about family and American values and personal character. Then you have an old photo of the President's girlfriend. You scream about patriotism and you tell them she's to blame for their lot in life, you go on television and you call her a whore. Sydney Ellen Wade has done nothing to you, Bob. She has done nothing but put herself through law school, prosecute criminals for five years, represent the interests of public school teachers for two years, and lobby for the safety of our natural resources. You want a character debate? Fine, but you better stick with me,'cause Sydney Ellen Wade is way out of your league. I've loved two women in my life.

These men are all Russian mob. Not like those two peons in the alley the other day. These guys are all syndicate bosses and underbosses. I have a dossier on every man in this room. Since the Iron Curtain has gone down, the Russian syndicates have started to come here. And in the spirit of Glasnost the Soviets have opened their borders to the mafia. But the Italians, they're not convinced that the grounds in mother Russia are fertile enough for organized crime yet. So they ain't ready to commit. The Russians are coming here anyway. They are unwelcome. What we have here, gentlemen, is possibly the beginning of the first international mob war.

Some barrier within the younger Bloom was broken.
This is the end. Charelston, you've always been a dunce. So in the end, everyone gets everything he wants. That's what he does, he writes his cons the way dead Russians write novels, with thematic arcs and imbedded symbolism and shit. And he wrote me as a vulnerable anti- hero. And that's why you think you want to kiss me.
Trying to get something real by telling yourself stories is a trap. Trust me on that one. Best of luck with the antiquing, boys.

What they seek in their frenzied assaults on their victims is relief from passivity. For these men, ten minutes relief is worth far more than the life of another human being. Torture, the pain they inflict, the screams of the victim, are all part of the ritual that gives them a brief respite from their own psychic pain. And then the depression, the forgetting, the feeling of sadness and despair begins the cycle all over again. Like addicts seeking their drug, Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono, Berkowitz, Dahmer, Bundy, they seek out their next victim. The cycle is endless until they are caught. And they are caught by chance, they run a red light, and a body is in the trunk. A leaking pipe brings a plumber to a basement where they is the smell of death. At any time, right now, as you listen, the FBI estimates there are 30 to 35 serial killers stalking their victims. The serial killer is a plaque that must be addressed not only by the law, but by science.

Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs. Hartford, or maybe it was Maple? It's funny how sometimes the people we remember the least, make the greatest impression on us.

Will you still love me when I have pimples.

There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find. You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
Holy water.
There's not a day in my life when I don't feel like a fraud.

Dear Justine. Because of you I'll be quitting the Retail Rodeo. The last two days have been the most god-awful days of my life. I've not been able to get rid of you in my head. I never wanted anything so bad, and I have wanted many things. I'd given up long ago on being gotten by someone else, and then you came along. The idea of being gotten, because of circumstance, will never get got is the worst feeling I've ever felt, and I have felt many bad feelings. I'm sorry I can never see you again, Justine, forgive me for being so weak, but that is who I am. Goodbye, Holden Wurther. If for some reason, you could change your mind and want to be with me, body and soul, meet me after work. I will be waiting for you at five PM outside Chuck E.Cheese. If you are not there at five, you will never see me in your lifetime.
