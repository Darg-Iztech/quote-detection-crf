That I will indeed. Because of molecules we are connected to the outside world from our bodies. Like when you smell things, because when you smell a smell it's not really a smell, it's a part of the object that has come off of it, molecules. So when you smell something bad, it's like in a way you're eating it. This is why you should not really smell things, in the same way that you don't eat everything in the world around you - because as a smell, it gets inside of you. So the next time you go into the bathroom after someone else has been there, remember what kinds of molecules you are in fact eating. It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.

Good evening, this is the BBC National and World programme, broadcasting from Buckingham Palace. His Majesty, the King. In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history, I send to every household of my peoples, both at home and overseas. .this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself. For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war. For we are called, with our allies, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world. It is the principle which permits a State, in the selfish pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties and its solemn pledges; which sanctions the use of force, or threat of force, against the sovereignty and independence of other States. Such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right, and if this principle were established throughout the world, the freedom of our own country and of the whole British Commonwealth of Nations would be in danger. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 113. But far more than this - the peoples of the world would be kept in the bondage of fear, and all hopes of settled peace and of the security of justice and liberty among nations would be ended.

One of these, lives has a future. One of them does not. I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson. You are here because we need your help. We know that you have been contacted by a certain individual. A man who calls himself Morpheus. Whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant to the fact that he is wanted for acts of terrorism in more countries than any other man in the world. He is considered by many authorities to be the most dangerous man alive. My colleagues believe that I am wasting my time with you, but I believe you want to do the right thing.

Down there everything is so still and silent that it lulls me to sleep. It is a weird lullaby and so it is; it is mine.
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch. And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.

She's executed it with dignity, honour and, as far as I can tell, without a single blemish - and now we line up baying for her blood - why?

Only way to beat that guy is to take yourself out of the game.
All you have in common is that you both secretly want to be me.
The Yellow Pages. Welcome, friends and family!
Somebody buy my wooha a drink.
These people are right. Eyes open and pair off!

My rate isnt arbitrary.
With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere. Ill teach you a trick. If you look people in the eye, theyll never even notice what you have on.

Oh, I'm a failure, because I haven't got a brain.
And I'm not going to leave here ever, ever again, because I love you all! And, Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!'The young girl sat perfectly still in the confessional. listening to her father's boots scrape like chalk on the ancient steps of the church, then grow faint, then disappear altogether.'Let me get this straight. The girl with the big lips is depressed because, each night, when her father goes off to work at the bakery, her mother sneaks some mysterious lover into the house. Not only does this girl have to listen to her mother working this guy in the next room, she has to wash the sheets each morning before Daddy gets home. After a few weeks of this, she starts to go a little nutty/ so Daddy takes her to confession only, once she gets in the box, she gets a whiff of the priest and realizes he's the mother's secret lover.
Is morally,ethic'ly As Coroner, I must aver I thoroughly examined her. And she's not only merely dead, She's really, most sincerely dead.
How did you guess?
Oh
Well, I'm going to start in on you right here - one after the other!
My mouth, my mouth! He said his mouth.
I'll fight you with my eyes closed.
And if we don't, Aunt Em may, well, she may die!
Where's my baggy pants?
Ah, now we've got them! Half you go that way, half you go that way!
where I come from we have universities, seats of great learning, where men go to become great thinkers. And when they come out, they think deep thoughts, and with no more brains than you have.
It's always best to start at the beginning, and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
Who would have thought a good little girl like you could destroy my beautiful wickedness!?
Go on, hurry up!
where I come from there are men who do nothing all day but good deeds. They are called phil.er, er, phil, er, yes.good-deed-doers. And their hearts are no bigger than yours. But! They have one thing you haven't got! A testimonial! Therefore, in consideration of your kindness, I take pleasure at this time in presenting you with a small token of our esteem and affection. And remember, my sentimental friend. .that a heart is not judged by how much you love, but by how much you are loved by others.
Great
Every, It's all right! Everything is all right!
Ahh Oh, it ticks!
Almira Gulch, just because you own half the county doesn't mean you have the power to run the rest of us! For twenty- three years, I've been dying to tell you what I thought of you!
Who are you?
Well, I, I, I am the Great and Powerful, Wizard of Oz.
Oh, my!
Long Live the King! If. I
Oh, don't go without me!
You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death, sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.
.Ain't it the truth! Ain't it the truth!
Now I know I've got a heart,'cause it's breaking.
It's so kind of you to visit me in my loneliness.
Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
Very well, I'll bide my time, and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way. MCU
I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing, and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.
Only bad witches are ugly. The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
I'm not pretty.
Time to say goodnight.
Help me.
A man tires of being executed. But then again.There is no point in living if youcan't.feel alive.
A man tires of being executed. But then again.There is no point in living if youcan't.feel alive.
There's no Y incision here; no internal exam. You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris. I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either. You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
men I work with will stop at nothing to clear the way for what they believe is their stake in the inevitable future. I was ordered to kill Kurtzweil. A necessary action to protect my grandchildren's lives. I might just as easily kill you. Trust no one, Mr. Mulder. You have precious little time.

If I quit now, they win.
Mr.

You wan na put your hands on your head, please? Louise, shoot the radio.
You let her go, you fat fucking asshole, or I'm gon na splatter your ugly face all over this nice car. Now, calm down. We were just havin'a little fun. Looks like you've got a real fucked up idea of fun. Now turn around. Just for the future, when a woman's crying like that, she's not having any fun!
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
You let her go, you fat fucking asshole, or I'm gon na splatter your ugly face all over this nice car. Now, calm down. We were just havin'a little fun. Looks like you've got a real fucked up idea of fun.
You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing.
You're a real live outlaw! I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin'my heart.
, I almost feel like I know you.
Don't worry about it.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
You know what happens. The volume gets turned way up and the next thing you know those girls are gon na get shot.
Get the fuck out of my way, man!
Oh boy, am I pissed.
when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex.
When I was sixteen years old I fell in love.
You fucking prick, we had a deal you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture.
That she knew my name blew my mind. Some of my best friends didn't know my name.
Get ready to send your staffer in.
I understand.
Would you like me to call a car, Mr.O'Donnell.
Mr. Zorin, I remind you that the other day you did not deny the existence of these weapons.
We were eyeball to eyeball and I think the other fellow just blinked.
I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs. They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here. We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock'em up together in there, kick'em in the ass til they come up with options.
Ambassador
We do what they want us to, none of us will be alive to tell'em they were wrong.
Mr. President, Gromyko should be on his way by now.
Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
I remember giving the order to go to DEFCON 3, but I must be suffering from amnesia because I've just been informed our nuclear forces are DEFCON 2! Mr. President, the orders were limited to our strategic forces in the continental U.S. Technically, General LeMay is correct that SAC has the statutory authority I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
Yeah
Then you must excuse me and permit me to relay the substance of our discussion to my superiors. We have heard stories that some among your military men wish for war. You are a good man. Your brother is a good man. I assure you there are other good men. Let us hope the will of good men is enough to counter the terrible strength of this thing which has been put in motion.
The Soviet understands only one language: action. It respects only one word: force.
If we go ahead with these air strikes. There's got to be something else. Give it to me.
Mr.
Jesus
Jesus
The Big Red Dog is digging in our back yard, and we're justified in shooting him. Sir, we have a rapidly closing window of opportunity where we can prevent those missiles from ever becoming operational. The other options. do not guarantee the end result we can guarantee. However, the more time that goes by, the less reliable the choice we can offer you becomes.
And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President. John
Jesus
is Major Anderson.
Mr. President, we can get better than ninety percent of them. As of seveno'clock Monday night, all United States armed forces world wide will stand up to DEFCON 3. You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support. They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me. The elected representatives of the people have spoken. Now let's tell the people. Good evening, my fellow citizens.
That's right, inoculate you.
Happy
And I will do it kill or cure.
Here I am, you lucky people! Dwights hustles the bags into the trunk, tells Toby to kiss his mother, and hops into the car, all smiles, all cheeriness.
Dwight
And Champ's your dog. Jesus, I trade some old piece of crap for a valuable hunting dog, and all you can do is piss and moan.
Am I supposed to just crawl off in a ditch someplace and die?
So don't go crying to Mama,'cause Mama won't listen. Mama is sick to death of her baby boy. And your rich Daddy Warbucks and your Princeton brother don't give a shit about you,'cause Caroline told me they haven't even written in over two years. So it looks like I'm all you got now, it's just you and me. Feels sort of inevitable, doesn't it, hotshot? It's like we were fated for each other, like I'm the one guy on Earth could set you straight. And don't you ever think I won't enjoy doing it,'cause. Dear Toby, I sure do miss you, honey, the house is like a tomb since you left. So quiet. My only entertainment tonight was watching Marian eat a whole pint of ice cream.
You feel like everybody else is inside, and you're stuck on the outside. It turns you mean. It turns you ugly. And one day do you hear me, Dwight? One day all that ugliness is going to snap back and hit you in the face.
Now if you lived with your daddy Duke and his rich wife, maybe things'd be different, but he's not here now, is he?
May
I don't recognize you, sir.
And you will show us where the bullion is right now.
Because I've got a family and if I shit in a bag the rest of my life cuz I got shot after the war's already over that would be pretty fucking stupid, wouldn't it? What is the most important thing in life?
This is fucked up.
For twenty. Twenty dollars, man, what's the meaning of life? You're lucky you got to see anybody shot in this war.
United
Only when he's really pissed off.
That's what I hear.
You have nothing to fear.
If I make a mistake, it's all over. You see it every day. Do you want to see me taken away in pieces? I don't want to lose you. .and it all happened so slowly that most men failed to realize that anything had happened at all. They had never known what all know within, that to know is not to know, not to know is to be known.
Okay, hit it.
Way I see it, you need us alive.
Utterly exposed, completely vulnerable, the inner child trying to get out. My inner child needs spanking.
I was playing to win. A defining moment when you tried to hit the same impossible cut Greatness courts failure, Romeo. That's why most people, in their whole lives, never ever reach for the brass ring, never know when to dig deep and try for the impossible shot.
A former paramour once ascribed my fluid sense of time to being born under the sign of Pisces, something about floating through the universe You amuse me, Roy. But I'm the only woman in America born after World War II who thinks astrology is a crock of shit. Now let's see if the Big Dog'll eat.
Oh, jeez.
I'm not interested in that piece of shit.
Molly, trust me on this one.
There's a red light, you shoulda stopped.
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

And these were drawn from life?

Now
I saw my whole life as if I'd already lived it. an endless parade of parties and cotillions, yachts and polo matches. always the same narrow people, the same mindless chatter. I felt like I was standing at a great precipice, with no one to pull me back, no one who cared. or even noticed.
Remember, the only thing they respect is money, so just act like you've got a lot of it and you're in the club.
Don't do it.

Collapsible A is whirled like a leaf in the currents around the sining ship.

There has been progress and there have been failures, but where we have fallen short I see not a problem but an opportunity. An opportunity to correct the mistakes of the past while laying a solid foundation for the future. This takes not only new ideas, but perseverance. This takes not only resources, but courage. This takes not only government, but families.

Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says,'the more you eat, the more you want.'.

Morning
I don't know what it is about the desert.
I got to get some stuff out of the trunk.

I have to do some things.
Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?.
I bought a whole bunch.

Jesus Christ, no. Please inform the ambulance we have a situation. I've never seen this. It appears your infant sustained some fractures while in your uterus. His arms and legs are broken. Someone left these.
Listen man, I didn't know you were in- Just choose something all right?
That's not nearly good enough for me.
You didn't break one bone.
I have a speech to make. I like you people, but you are sentimental shits. You fall in love with the poets, the poets fall in love with the Marxists, the Marxists fall in love with themselves. The country is destroyed with rhetoric, and in the end we are stuck with tyrants.

She ain't got no face left an'you're gon na give her a goddamn mangy pony. He ain't m-m-mangy,ma'am, he.
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
You know there ain't a straight angle in that whole goddamn porch. or in the whole house for that matter. He's the worst fucking carpenter.
You know how women kin lie. I knock'em around a little, ask'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?.
Take a shit.
If Delilah don't care one way or the other, what're you so riled about? Just because them smelly assholes like to ride us like horses don't mean we got to let'em brand us like we're horses. Maybe we ain't nothin'but whores, but by God we ain't horses. I got a hundred an'twelve dollars. That's everythin'.
I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an'now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned. Now step aside. boys
I am a damn badman an'you will not find a worse one in hell.
I curse you! You're cursed!

Welcome back, Mr. Bingham. All the things you probably hate about travelling - The recycled air. The artificial lighting. The digital juice dispensers and mini pizzas stacked to their heat lamps are the warm reminders that I am home.
Tonight, most people will be welcomed home by jumping dogs and squealing kids. Their spouses will ask about their day and tonight they'll sleep. The stars will wheel forth from their daytime hiding places. And one of those lights, slightly brighter than the rest, will be my wingtip, passing over, blessing them.
Would you stop condescending for one second? Or is that one of the principles of your bullshit philosophy?
You know how fucked this place is without me? You know how fucked this place is without me? Fucked in the ass, man.
To your music?
I think he needs a priest.
Jesus Christ! Don't hurt me!
What I think is that this man must be stopped. Stopped at all costs and no one, I repeat, no one is to be placed above suspicion.
I killed you ten minutes ago.
She couldn't live with betraying me, with giving up that last inch.

I can't initiate Valkyrie without confirmation that Hitler's dead. It's too great a risk.
The Fhrer is fine. That's a lie. Hitler is dead.
If I could only avoid sleep, but I can't. I try to tell myself what to dream. I try to dream that I'm flying, something freeing. It never works. Viewed in shadow, he rises out of bed. Is that the only thing that you dream? Walking down a hallway, a pretty woman with red hair beckons.
The Sweet and Sour speech again. A lot of people are scared of heights. It's not the heights that bother me, it's the impact that terrifies me. I won't stay long. She laughs. It was never his decision to make.
This music continues.
Talking heads expressing the convictions of Life Extension. Compassionate, expressive people. The bits of their testimonials echo phrases from David's own life. and I'm not a'true believer'by nature.

She must be exhausted from trying to be witty for you all night long.

Well, at the risk of boring you, I can present the alternate argument. I once knew a guy who was a real loner. And one day he woke up at 40, with two daughters who lit his life up with purpose. Suddenly he goes to endless school plays, he gets home at 9:20 for the evening discussion, and he has the time of his life. His favorite Beatle was once John, and now it's Paul. I always liked.
Because I can't think straight most of the time.
Welcome to Life Extension. Have a look at our proposal.

When I was younger you used to hold my arm when I walked. Then suddenly you stopped. One day, I even tripped in your presence and nearly fell.

my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory. Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $ 200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being'comfortable', I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud, or nothing.
Super job!
You're not as smart as I thought you were, Buddy boy, Listen hard, don't count on Graham and Dodd to make you a fortune, everybody in the market knows the theory, ever wonder why fund managers can't beat the S & P 500?'Cause they're sheep, and the sheep get slaughtered. I been in the business since'69. Most of these high paid MBAs from Harvard never make it. You need a system, discipline, good people, no deal junkies, no toreadores, the deal flow burns most people out by 35. Give me PSHs, poor, smart and hungry. And no feelings. You don't win'em all, you don't love'em all, you keep on fighting, and if you need a friend, get a dog, it's trench warfare out there sport. and in here too.

How much is enough Gordon? The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do, stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth.
Then when contradictory rumors later surfaced that the takeover was unfounded, buyers went running for cover, and the stock plummeted on gigantic volume to as low as 16 1/2 before closing at 17. but then tonight, amidst all the scuttlebutt, another rumble shook According to many sources, raider Sir Lawrence Wildman has stepped in and bought a substantial block of Bluestar and is going to announce a deal tomorrow at 18 that includes the support of the unions.
Come on. You guys know the new chief of Bluestar. Bud Fox. Look guys, what's the problem, let's for the kill.Gekko's got 12 % and climbing plus the unions are in his pocket for now, everybody on the street knows the stock's in play by next week the street's gon na own Bluestar and management won't be able to do anything but poison their own pill.
You're full of shit! One thing I do know is this paper company lost $ 110 million last year, and I'd bet half of that is in the paperwork going back and forth between all the vice presidents. The new law of evolution in corporate America seems to be'survival of the unfittest'. Well in my book, you either do it right or you get eliminated. Teldar Paper is doomed to fail. Its diversification into casualty insurance has not worked. Its crown jewels are its trees, the rest is dross. Through wars, depressions, inflations and deterioration of paper money, trees have always kept their value, but Teldar is chopping them all down. Forests are perishable, forest rights are as important as human rights to this planet, and all the illusory Maginot lines, scorched earth tactics, proxy fights, poison pills, etc. that Mr. Cromwell is going to come up with to prevent people like me from buying Teldar Paper are doomed to fail because the bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, as you very well know, is the only way to stay strong is to create value, that's why you buy stock, to have it go up. If there's any other reason, I've never hear it. That's all I'm saying.it's you people who own this company, not them, they work for you and they've done a lousy job of it. Get rid of them fast, before you all get sick and die. I may be an opportunist, but if these clowns did a better job, I'd be out of work. In the last seven deals I've been in, there were 2.3 million stockholders that actually made a pretax profit of $ 12 billion. When I bought the Ixtlan Corporation it was in the exact same position Teldar is today, I turned three of its companies private and I sold four others, and each of these companies, liberated from the suffering conglomerate has prospered. I am not a destroyer of companies, I am a liberator of them. The point is, ladies and gentlemen, greed is good. Greed works, greed is right. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed in all its forms, greed for life, money, love, knowledge, has marked the upward surge of mankind, and greed, mark my words, will save not only Teldar Paper but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA.Thank you.
Look, I have no illusions about winning a popularity contest with any of you. I was roasted the other night, and a friend of mine asked why are we honoring this man have we run out of human beings? It's not always the most popular guy who gets the job done. You got losses of 20 to 30 million dollars, dividends cut to zero, you're getting squeezed to death by the majors. Present management may not be the worst scum of the earth, but they're the ones who've put you on a kamikaze course, and pretty soon everybody's going to be scrambling for the parachutes. Only there aren't enough to go around.
That's a girl. That's my girl.

Hey dad! From the moment the invaders arrived, breathed our air, ate and drank, they were doomed. They were undone, destroyed, after all of man's weapons and devices had failed, by the tiniest creatures that God and his wisdom, put upon this earth. At the toll of a billion deaths, man had earned his immunity, is right to survive among this planet's infinite organisms. And that right is ours against all challenges, for men do not live nor die in vein.
No one would have believed in the early years of the21st century, that our world was being watched by intelligences greater than our own. That as men busied themselves about their various concerns, they observed and studied. Like the way a man with a microscope might scrutinize the creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro about the globe, confident of our empire over this world. Yet, across the gulf of space, intellects, vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded our plant with envious eyes.

Leaders Call Dr. Manhattan:'America's Weapon of Satan.'' What I'm saying is this whole bringing back the Watchmen thing is bullshit.

Look, Rorschach and I have made real headway on the gang problem by pooling our efforts. Rorschach's voice is quiet, not yet its tortured rasp. That's true. But something like this seems too big.
