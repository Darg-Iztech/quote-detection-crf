I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin'history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'? I haven't killed anybody since 1974. Goddamn his soul to burn for eternity in fuckin'hell for makin'me spill blood on my hands! Go to this comedian's son's apartment and come back with somethin'that tells me where that asshole went so I can wipe this egg off of my face and fix this fucked-up family for good.

You all came home. And with you, my life of details.
We have a lot to get through.
Make me famous through the world, dear God! Make me immortal! After I die let people speak my name forever with love for what I wrote! In return I vow I will give you my chastity - my industry, my deepest humility, every hour of my life. And I will help my fellow man all I can.
Listen to me, it's over. No one has ever dumped me. I'm not trying to make history.
Don't play no reindeer games with me.
The answer is there. Max, it's a bug.
Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man. Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex ... Jail, you asshole! Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!
Burn gas on the freeways, and whip your sour cream of circumstance ... flip at your channels and plod at your monitors ... Creation is, all else is not ... what is not creation is meatless sausage, and rice cake, let it all crumble to feed the artist - The artist is, all others are not, a canvas is a canvas or a painting, a rock is a rock or a statue, a sound is a sound or it is music, a preacher is a preacher or an artist - Walter passes ART, seated with two attractive women - he rolls himself a cigarette, nodding in approval to Maxwell - Where are John Joe Jake Jim Jerk, dead dead dead, they were not born before they were born, they were not born, where are Leonardo, Mozart, Shakespeare, alive alive alive, they were born - Bring on the multitudes and the multitude of fishes - feed them that you will be satisfied, nourish the artist, stretch their skin upon an easel, crush their bones into a paste, so that he may mold them, let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark - that he might take you in his magic hands and wring from your marrow wonder - all that is comes through the eye of the artist - The rest are blind fish, swimming in the cave of aloneness- swim on you mortal and muddling maddened souls - and dream, of one bright and sunny island - some artist will bait a hook, and let you bite upon it, bite hard, and die - In his stomach
You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours ...?
So forget any ideas you've got about lost cities, exotic travel, and digging up the world. Eve do not follow maps to buried treasure and `` X'' never, ever, marks the spot.
You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood -- I don't want you to -- There is nothing to understand but this: I am a man who could have been great, but was not.

Forrest, I never thanked you for saving my life. He never actually said so, but I think he made his peace with God. For the second time in seventeen days, President Ford escaped possible assassination today when a woman, Sarah Jane Moore, fired on him as he stepped out of a hotel in San Francisco.

As difficult as it was to reach Spectre, I was fated to get there eventually. After all, no man can avoid reaching the end of his life. And then I realized, this wasn't the end of my life. This isn't how I die.

Finally she comes into view: along the silent, empty corridors, coming at last to a door with two guards standing rigid in front of it. Full armour, powerful shockrifles, expressions empty and cold. Along a row of screens, where we see the first signs of life readouts, lights, data -- all shifting and collating on the blinking screens.
All these horrible realities began to dawn on me. Here I was, alone in Las Vegas, with this goddamned incredibly expensive car, completely twisted on drugs, no cash, no story for the magazine. And on top of everything else I had a gigantic goddamn hotel bill to deal with.
You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive! Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong. If anything, I'm making it sound good.
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact. I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories. You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything!

I think ... I think sex is overrated. I think people place way too much importance on it. And I think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap. I m not saying women don't want it, I just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.

It's hard to choose a favorite track among so many great ones, but `` The Greatest Love of All'' is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about self-preservation and dignity. It's universal message crosses all boundaries, and instills one with the hope that it's not too late to better ourselves. to act kinder. Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in the world we live in to empathize with others, we can always empathize with ourselves. It's an important message, crucial, really, and it's beautifully stated on the album. Not the face, you bitch. Not the fucking face, you piece of bitch trash! I want a firm commitment.
Tell them they have the wrong family.
This is a hell of a time to be draggin'up old business. People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know.

I look through the New Yorker when my neighbor's done with it, and I'm not averse to going down to the Fine Arts to watch subtitles films, although on the whole I prefer American films. Top five being Blade Runner, Cool Hand Luke, the first two Godfathers which we'll count as one, Taxi Driver, and The Shining. I'm okay looking, average height, not skinny, not fat. My genius, if I can call it that, is to combine a whole load of averageness into one compact frame. You might say there were millions like me, but there aren't, really: Alot of guys have impeccable music taste but don't read, alot of guys read but are really fat, alot of guys are sympathetic to women but have stupid beards, alot of guys have a Woody Allen sense of humor but look like Woody Allen. Some drink too much, some drive like assholes, some get into fights, or show off money, or do drugs. I don't do any of these things, really. If I do okay with women it's not because of the virtues I have, but because of the ugly flaws I don't have ... So.

... As many of you know, the past few months of my life have been very difficult. I don't know how I would have gotten through it without all of you. I really think it is a testament to the love in this institution, that I stand before you today, as the first straight `` C'' student in school history voted Valedictorian. Again, to Marvin Tepperman, the real valedictorian, he deserved this and I want to wish him a speedy recovery. I spoke to his doctors today and they say, with medication and therapy, Marvin should be able to attend Harvard this fall. While I may not have excelled in the classroom, I think my recent experiences in that bigger schoolhouse we call `` life'', have taught me a few lessons that I'd like to share with my fellow graduates. Follow your heart and don't question it, now matter where it tells you to go. Trust me, it'll open up a world of new experiences you can't even imagine. But as you listen to it, don't forget your family, your parents. Don't forget they're people too, and while we may not always agree with them, remember to love them when they need love. And I mean really love them, don't just pay them lip service.
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude. And I dig that about you.

And I'm real happy with myself,'cause I did my job well. But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East. Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen hundred people I never had a problem with get killed. Now the politicians are sayin'`` send in the Marines to secure the area'''cause they don't give a shit. It won't be their kid over there, gettin'shot.

The girl with the big lips is depressed because, each night, when her father goes off to work at the bakery, her mother sneaks some mysterious lover into the house. Not only does this girl have to listen to her mother working this guy in the next room, she has to wash the sheets each morning before Daddy gets home. After a few weeks of this, she starts to go a little nutty/ so Daddy takes her to confession -- only, once she gets in the box, she gets a whiff of the priest and realizes he's the mother's secret lover.
I'm not your fuckin'dada.
And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me. There is no `` right''. When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.

Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept� Francoise voice fades away over an image of the night sky. Time lapse: the sky rapidly changes to day. When you develop an infatuation for someone, you always find a reason to believe that this is exactly the person for you. It doesn't need to be a good reason, a bad one will do just as well. Taking photographs of the night sky, for example: in the long run that's just the kind of dumb irritating habit that would cause you to split up. But at the time - it's the charming eccentricity you've been searching for all these years.

Do you think it's a personal matter with me, this boy? Are you telling me I see things in terms of personal pique? Don't you see that today that boy wiped his feet on the choice, on the predilections of sixty million men and women of the greatest country in the world! If you had any morals yourself, you would understand the immorality of that boy's stand today! It was not me he criticized - it was my readers!

It's on the level.
We're happy.
But I remembered something Carlyle wrote: `` ... there is no life of a man, faithfully recorded, but is a heroic poem of its sort, rhymed or unrhymed.'' I realized my salvation might be in recording my wasted life, unflinchingly. Maybe it would serve as a cautionary tale.

Nothing had slipped, nothing had been overlooked, there was nothing to give us away. And yet, Keyes, as I was walking down the street to the drug store, suddenly it came over me that everything would go wrong. It sounds crazy, Keyes, but it's true, so help me: I couldn't hear my own footsteps. It was the walk of a dead man.

You think you got the market cornered on human suffering? Well let me tell you something about `` People like me.'' People like me feel little and lost and ugly and dispensable. People like me have perfect husbands screwing someone far more perfect than me and my son, my son hates me, I try too hard and I push and he knows it and I talk in that voice, that voice I promised I'd never use, and I've screamed, I've screamed horrible things to him, a five year-old because he doesn't want to get in the car at the end of a day and he stares at me with such anger and I hate him then. I know I'm failing you, I know I'm disappointing you, I know you deserve better but get in the fucking car! It's like every morning I wake up and fail, and I look around and anybody, anybody can pull it off, but somehow I can't. And I know, I know I have everything, and I'm still miserable and it's pathetic. I know it's pathetic. No matter how hard I try, something about me will never be enough.
Stephanie rushes over to steady her.
God!
Of all the fuckin'things she coulda forgot, she forgets my father's watch.
You used to be all about the girl stuff: stealing, boning, blowing shit up. Now you're like this little priss with a conscience. It's really a fucking drag. We all got ta grow up some time. If moping around over some little boy you're crushing on is being grown- up, then pass me my Wonder Woman underoos.
Are you hurt?
I am here to tell you about your options ... I work here for seventeen years and they send some fourth grader in here to can me? What the fuck is this?! It's perfectly normal to be upset. However, the sooner you can tell yourself that there are greater opportunities waiting for you ... Greater opportunities? I'm fifty- seven-fucking years old! Anybody who ever built an empire, or changed the world, sat where you are now.
Hello ... She kisses him and they look at the blue ocean and the white sand and green sea grass and she puts an arm around him. If I were God I would have made the world just so and no different ... And so I have you. .I have you.

He felt something had to be done to create a better world. He stole little me from my mother, his ex-wife, and raised me, with love and tenderness and respect, as an ape like himself. Apes don't assassinate their presidents, gentlemen. Until quite recently I believed myself to be an ape, although I didn't know specifically what type. Apes don't think in terms of type. It might be argued, gentlemen, that apes don't even know that they are apes. In retrospect, however, I'd say that I was a pygmy chimp. I have to say I always hated apes.

When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy. I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband -- Are you nuts? Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car. Listen, we're beginning to make real money for the first time.

Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me!

Doris and I had never really talked much. I don't think that's a bad thing, necessarily. But it was funny: now I wanted to talk -- now, with everyone gone. I was alone, with secrets I didn't want and no one to tell them to anyway. I visited a woman who was supposed to have powers in communicating with those who had passed across, as she called it. She said that people who passed across were picky about who they'd communicate with, not like most people you run into on this side ... Giff me your hant.
You're no fucking general. You're a copying machine salesman. You're not even a good painter. Are you trying to goad me into a fight? Wouldn't it be great if wars could be fought just by the assholes who started them? We could settle this thing right here. You and me. Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.
I don't know but I kindly doubt it. Hell's bells, they even shot the dog.
There is a storm coming in.
I'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, I've had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man -- and if I have not that, I have nothing. Then I am only a cabman and a grave-robber. Let be, Toddy. Let be. I have no wish to hurt you.
It's just such a slap in the face.
No, in Paris it's good to smell like you've been fucking.
A COOK stands on the horizon waving a white flag at the end of a fishing pole. Ursula bounds through the wheat blowing a horn. Benson consults the large clock strapped to the back of his buggy, then fires a smoke pistol in the air.
Let me have A dram of poison, such soon- speeding gear As will disperse itself through all the veins That the life-weary taker may fall dead. Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law Is death to any he that utters them. The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law. Then be not poor, but break it and take this.

They're'sposed to be beat up just like us but everybody knows that Tucker's men are tough as cobs. I sure don't wan na die out there with them cows. Some of the boys are sayin'that if we ain't gon na fight we could just settle the whole business with a little high stakes poker. Wouldn't that be a sight ... a bunch of fellas sittin'in the middle of this field drawin'cards ... Tucker!
I've been searching for a long time for somebody who can make these machines do things they're not supposed to do. Do you catch my drift, brother? I knew you would. And best of all, you seem to be able to do it in such a way that the deed goes undetected.
I've never had anyone die before ...
Terrible things were happening all around us ... Order some golf shoes. Otherwise, we'll never get out of this place alive. It's impossible to walk in this muck -- no footing at all ... I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds! If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.

You see, I'm not sure if you know this ... but there are two kinds of fat people. There's fat people that were born to be fat, and then there's fat people that were once thin but they became fat ... so when you look at them you can sorta see that thin person inside!

... it was amateur night, and you could tell. Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger side. But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew, was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat. It's the only thing that saved my life. The bombing was never authorized, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse.
Do you mind if I have a go?
When you leave, you should forget me.
Note to the galley: Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions. But is wasn't the ale. That was just the excuse we needed to say all the things that were really on our minds ... Captain Kirk, you are wanted on the bridge.
Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking. I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all. I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I can not satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other.

Harry persisted in the necessity of instant departure, in which argument, as I was anxious to see the world, I must confess, I sided with him; and my mother was brought to see that, in our small house, in the midst of a village, escape would be impossible, and capture would be impossible to avoid. Roderick, my darling, my wild boy, I have forebodings that our separation is to be a long one. I spent most of all night consulting the cards regarding your fate in the duel, and all signs betoke a separation. Here is twenty guineas -- all that I have in the world -- and I want you to keep your father's sword and pistols, which you have known to use so like a man. She hurried my departure now, though her heart, I know, was full, and almost in half-an-hour from my arrival at home, I was once more on the road again, with the wide world, as it were, before me. No lad of seventeen is very sad who has liberty for the first time, and twenty guineas in his pocket; and I rode away, thinking, I confess, not so much of the kind of mother left alone, and of the home behind me, as of tomorrow, and all the wonders it would bring. I had no doubts of the future; thinking that a man of my person, parts, and courage, could make his way anywhere. So I rode on, singing to myself, or chatting with the passersby; and all the girls along the road said, `` God save me, for a clever gentleman.'' As for thoughts of Dorothy Dugan, there seemed to be a gap of a half- a-score of years.

Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart.

Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday.
As soon as I smelt the air, I knew I was home. There was sadness there, rich, almost sweet, like the fragrance of jasmine. I walked the streets, savouring it like a long lost perfume ... And then on Prytania Street, only blocks from the Lafayette cemetery I caught the scent of death and it wasn't coming from the graves ... The scent grew stronger as I walked. Old death. A scent too faint for mortals to detect. They were like the doomed princess caught in the thorny vines of Sleeping Beauty's castle.
They got this skinny kid named Rory Tremont to go in the hole. He wasn't much in the brains department, but he possessed the one most important qualification for the job ...

I love it when guys peel out.
I'd never see you again.
Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man.
I'll say there was a death or something.

Things are a little better these days; I finally swallowed that chicken bone, Judy and I are gon na be in the same home room and the republican party just re-nominated Mr. Nixon. I remember before I was born, wounded up like a fur ball in the highly overrated fetal position, luckily I'm not claustrophobic, but on rainy days I still feel a tightness in my left shoulder.
Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts, time can draw out like a blade ... That was the longest night of my life ...

`` Greek for `` I found it! `` and is so overwhelmed he runs dripping naked through the streets to the King's castle to report his discovery. Now, what's the moral of the story. That a breakthrough will come ... Wrong. The point of the story is the wife. Listen to your wife, she will give you perspective. Meaning, you need a break, Max, you have to take a bath, otherwise you'll get nowhere. There will be no order, only chaos. Go home and take a bath.
Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camero down on the corner of Argyle there.
All I need to find you Louis is follow the corpses of rats. Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire.
I cut that grass for free. But at nighttime, when there was nothing to do and the house was all empty, I'd always think of Jenny. And then, she was there.
The scene comes alive with specific activity: weeping Hazel, a little boy in the back playing with dirt clods, a man and a woman eyeing each other flirtatiously from a distance, an old woman with Parkinson's fiddling with Rosary beads, a well- dressed woman squatting and peeing near a gravesite. A minister addresses the mourners. Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for twenty years. And you'll never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say there is no fate, but there is: it's what you create. Even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes or it seems to but doesn't really. And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope for something good to come along. Something to make you feel connected, to make you feel whole, to make you feel loved. And the truth is I'm so angry and the truth is I'm so fucking sad, and the truth is I've been so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long have been pretending I'm ok, just to get along, just for, I don't know why, maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery, because they have their own, and their own is too overwhelming to allow them to listen to or care about mine.
A few minutes later.
Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin'them in the parking lot. A person's got to hate themselves to act like that. Have you ever met a bigger shithead than my stepfather?

That boy made me nervous.

Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.''

I know why you denied my sister. When I was younger you used to hold my arm when I walked. Then suddenly you stopped. One day, I even tripped in your presence and nearly fell.

Well I changed my mind!
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit?
I was remembering the simple pleasures of this job, how I ended up here out of law school, the way a stadium sounds when one of my players performs well on the field ... I was remembering even the words of the late Dicky Fox, the original sports agent, who said: The key to this job is personal relationships. And suddenly it was all pretty clear. The answer was fewer clients. Caring for them, caring for ourselves, and the games too. Starting our lives, really. We must embrace what is still virginal about our own enthusiasm, we must crack open the tightly clenched fist and give back a little for the common good, we must simply be the best versions of ourselves ... that goodness will be unbeatable and the money will appear.
Look, Left, he likes you.

In the beginning, the universe was created. This made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move. Many races believe that it was created by some sort of God, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle 6 firmly believe that the entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure. The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call `` The Coming of Great White Handkerchief'' are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each.

She went down to Thorton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards. Spitting! By the time I got there, Mrs. Kindleman had sprayed the whole damn place ... She must have had a cold or something. It was enough to turn a grown man's stomach.

I don't get out as often as I'd like to, for some people DO find my appearance disturbing. Of course, I can't fault them. People are often frightened by what they don't understand. And it is hard to understand, even for myself, for you see, Mother was so very beautiful.
I don't want to go in there again.

We got a real nice, `` I don't fuck with you -- you don't fuck with me''

Every day of my waiting. Maybe you can't see my face, but if you could see my inside, my whatever you want to name it, my spirit, that's the fear I have deeper than any gash on my neck.
