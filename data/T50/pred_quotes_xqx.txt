It all lies in the fact that men think there are circumstances in which one may deal with human beings without love; and there are no such circumstances. One may deal with things without love. One may cut down trees, make bricks, hammer iron without love; but you can not deal with men without it, just as one can not deal with bees without being careful. If you deal carelessly with bees you will injure them, and will yourself be injured. And so with men. It can not be otherwise, because natural love is the fundamental law of human life. It is true that a man can not force another to love him, as he can force him to work for him; but it does not follow that a man may deal with men without love, especially to demand anything from them. If you feel no love, sit still, Nekhludoff thought; occupy yourself with things, with yourself, with anything you like, only not with men. You can only eat without injuring yourself when you feel inclined to eat, so you can only deal with men usefully when you love.
