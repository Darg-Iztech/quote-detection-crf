Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he can not distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love, and in order to occupy and distract himself without love he gives way to passions and coarse pleasures, and sinks to bestiality in his vices, all from continual lying to other men and to himself.

There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense.
'It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
If all else perished, and _he_ remained, _I_ should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not seem a part of it.
Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault. Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty. There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.
Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn't.
She is too fond of books, and it has turned her brain.
Come gentle night, come loving black-brow'd night, Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die, Take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night, And pay no worship to the garish sun.
It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour.
'If you look for perfection, you will never be satisfied.
Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at peace.
With freedom, flowers, books, and the moon, who could not be perfectly happy.
Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth.
Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.'
'But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman, and as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures. We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days.'

Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.
All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players: They have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts.
What are young men to rocks and mountains.

She was a vixen when she went to school, And though she be but little, she is fierce.
Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once. Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, It seems to me most strange that men should fear, Seeing that death, a necessary end, Will come when it will come.

'I am too fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr. Erskine.
I wish I were a girl again, half savage and hardy, and free; and laughing at injuries, not maddening under them.
'I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience.'

Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something tragic.

Always try to keep a patch of sky above your life, little boy,'he added, turning to me.

'Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.
At least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.
'I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow professes to say,'I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances require me so to do. I need not sell my soul to buy bliss. I have an inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I can not afford to give.'
You know I have.
They slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered.
CHAPTER XXXVIIICONCLUSION Reader, I married him.
Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
To sleep, perchance to dreamay, there's the rub, For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause.
I find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time. To be in company, even with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating. I love to be alone. I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.
Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever women.'
After a short pause, her companion added,'You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.'
I'd rather sing one wild song and burst my heart with it, than live a thousand years watching my digestion and being afraid of the wet.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
There are some things you learn best in calm, and some in storm.
I am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.
'They're a rotten crowd,'I shouted across the lawn.'You're worth the whole damn bunch put together.'
'Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the caveman had known how to laugh, history would have been different.'
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.

'Am I alive and a reality, or am I but a dream.'
Anne smiled and said,'My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever, well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is what I call good company.''You are mistaken,'said he gently,'that is not good company; that is the best.
She went on:'From the very beginningfrom the first moment, I may almost sayof my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.'
Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes.'
Every atom of your flesh is as dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.
Prejudices, it is well known, are most difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.
Books are the treasured wealth of the world and the fit inheritance of generations and nations.
'Ferreting in one's soul, one often ferrets out something that might have lain there unnoticed.
There is nothing more luxurious than eating while you read unless it be reading while you eat. Amabel did both: they are not the same thing, as you will see if you think the matter over.
'If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more.
For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn.'
In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars.
Words. Mere words. How terrible they were. How clear, and vivid, and cruel. One could not escape from them. And yet what a subtle magic there was in them. They seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words. Was there anything so real as words.
If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things through narrow chinks of his cavern.
The world is little, people are little, human life is little. There is only one big thing desire.
_advancing between Violet and Tanner_ Sir: there are two tragedies in life. One is not to get your heart's desire. The other is to get it.
I can not express it; but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you. What were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained here. My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff's miseries, and I watched and felt each from the beginning: my great thought in living is himself. If all else perished, and _he_ remained, _I_ should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not seem a part of it. My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I _am_ Heathcliff. He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.
I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and strong. He made me love him without looking at me.
But there are moments when one has to choose between living one's own life, fully, entirely, completelyor dragging out some false, shallow, degrading existence that the world in its hypocrisy demands.
By God it was awful'I couldn't forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisythey smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made … I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child.
Did my heart love till now. Forswear it, sight. For Ine'er saw true beauty till this night.
_Aside._ Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.
The greatest thing in the world is for a man to know that he is his own.
There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreamsnot through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart.
You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.'
I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer.
'And so do I. I've dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after, and changed my ideas: they've gone through and through me, like wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind. And this is one: I'm going to tell itbut take care not to smile at any part of it.'
I gave him my heart, and he took and pinched it to death, and flung it back to me. People feel with their hearts, Ellen: and since he has destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him: and I would not, though he groaned from this to his dying day, and wept tears of blood for Catherine.
There is no sin except stupidity.
XVIII Shall I compare thee to a summer's day. Thou art more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer's lease hath all too short a date: Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, And often is his gold complexion dimm'd, And every fair from fair sometime declines, By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd: But thy eternal summer shall not fade, Nor lose possession of that fair thouow'st, Nor shall death brag thouwander'st in his shade, When in eternal lines to time thougrow'st, So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour.
They spoke very little of their mutual feeling; pretty phrases and warm expressions being probably unnecessary between such tried friends.
Object is no expense.
'How can I be reasonable. To me our love was everything and you were my whole life. It is not very pleasant to realise that to you it was only an episode.'
'I don't want just words. If that's all you have for me you'd better go.'
Read the best books first, or you may not have a chance to read them at all.
A movement of Catherine's relieved me a little presently: she put up her hand to clasp his neck, and bring her cheek to his as he held her; while he, in return, covering her with frantic caresses, said wildly'You teach me now how cruel you've beencruel and false. _Why_ did you despise me. _Why_ did you betray your own heart, Cathy. I have not one word of comfort. You deserve this. You have killed yourself. Yes, you may kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears: they'll blight youthey'll damn you. You loved methen what _right_ had you to leave me. What rightanswer mefor the poor fancy you felt for Linton. Because misery and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us, _you_, of your own will, did it. I have not broken your heart_you_ have broken it; and in breaking it, you have broken mine. So much the worse for me that I am strong. Do I want to live. What kind of living will it be when youoh, God. would _you_ like to live with your soul in the grave.'
At the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things, we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land and sea be infinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable. We can never have enough of Nature.
His heart danced upon her movements like a cork upon a tide. He heard what her eyes said to him from beneath their cowl and knew that in some dim past, whether in life or reverie, he had heard their tale before.
Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt. May your eyes never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine. May you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the instrument of evil to what you wholly love.
So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.
He was mastered by the sheer surging of life, the tidal wave of being, the perfect joy of each separate muscle, joint, and sinew in that it was everything that was not death, that it was aglow and rampant, expressing itself in movement, flying exultantly under the stars and over the face of dead matter that did not move.
I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yieldingcertainly too little for the convenience of the world. I can not forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.'
The grief that does not speak Whispers theo'er-fraught heart, and bids it break.
'An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_.'
There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.

The soul, fortunately, has an interpreteroften an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreterin the eye.
We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.'
At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in otherspoor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinneryoung clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.
His heart beat faster as Daisy's white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips'touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.
I have to remind myself to breathealmost to remind my heart to beat.
No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart.
It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.
I always pass on good advice. It is the only thing to do with it. It is never of any use to oneself.
I have little left in myselfI must have you. The world may laughmay call me absurd, selfishbut it does not signify. My very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly vengeance on its frame.'
The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what Fiction means.
And it is better so.
'It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be helped. Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane.'I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.'Because,'he said,'I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to youespecially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame. And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly. As for you, you'd forget me.'
I was not born to be forced. I will breathe after my own fashion. Let us see who is the strongest.
'Whatever comes,'she said,'can not alter one thing. If I am a princess in rags and tatters, I can be a princess inside. It would be easy to be a princess if I were dressed in cloth of gold, but it is a great deal more of a triumph to be one all the time when no one knows it.
Fools admire everything in an author of reputation. For my part, I read only to please myself.
People are always blaming circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.
Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then. It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions.
History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.
Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it is always from the noblest motives.'
In a word, I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right, as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong.
As if you could kill time without injuring eternity.
Let them think what they liked, but I didn't mean to drown myself. I meant to swim till I sank but that's not the same thing.
I wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul.
Man is the vainest of all creatures that have their being upon earth.
But the actual result is that when two people are under the influence of the most violent, most insane, most delusive, and most transient of passions, they are required to swear that they will remain in that excited, abnormal, and exhausting condition continuously until death do them part.
My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I _am_ Heathcliff. He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.
It was always the becoming he dreamed of, never the being.
I'd rather take coffee than compliments just now.
Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.Mr.
Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her.
The awful thing is that beauty is mysterious as well as terrible. God and the devil are fighting there and the battlefield is the heart of man.
We are such stuff As dreams are made on; and our little life Is rounded with a sleep.
I will tell you what I will do and what I will not do. I will not serve that in which I no longer believe, whether it call itself my home, my fatherland, or my church: and I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my defence the only arms I allow myself to usesilence, exile and cunning.
I have grown to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it.
It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they can not find it. Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and millions are in silent revolt against their lot. Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth. Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.
Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word,'Lenore.'
The basis of optimism is sheer terror.
Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.
We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His omnipotence, His omnipresence.
If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away.
You must have a cigarette. A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied. What more can one want.
Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.
Things do not change; we change.
Whatever we had missed, we possessed together the precious, the incommunicable past.
The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles.
I. I'm nobody. Who are you. Are you nobody, too. Then there's a pair of us, don't tell. They'd banish us, you know. How dreary to be somebody. How public, like a frog To tell your name the livelong day To an admiring bog.
'Out of my thoughts. You are part of my existence, part of myself. You have been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, the rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been in every prospect I have ever seen since, on the river, on the sails of the ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the darkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become acquainted with. The stones of which the strongest London buildings are made are not more real, or more impossible to be displaced by your hands, than your presence and influence have been to me, there and everywhere, and will be. Estella, to the last hour of my life, you can not choose but remain part of my character, part of the little good in me, part of the evil. But, in this separation, I associate you only with the good; and I will faithfully hold you to that always, for you must have done me far more good than harm, let me feel now what sharp distress I may. O God bless you, God forgive you.'
'Ah,'she cried,'you look so cool.'Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table.'You always look so cool,'she repeated. She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw.
Moral wounds have this peculiarity, they may be hidden, but they never close; always painful, always ready to bleed when touched, they remain fresh and open in the heart.
The longest way must have its close, the gloomiest night will wear on to a morning.
'Education never ends, Watson. It is a series of lessons with the greatest for the last.
'Your father, Jo. He never loses patience, never doubts or complains, but always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed to do otherwise before him.
This was very pleasant; there is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove: O, no. it is an ever-fixed mark, That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark, Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior, who can not possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatuus_-like, into miry wilds whence there is no extrication.
'You see,'he explained,'I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.'
Melancholy were the sounds on a winter's night.
A little sincerity is a dangerous thing, and a great deal of it is absolutely fatal.
Procrastination is the thief of time.
'Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at peace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's house, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death is.'
It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.
If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman's inconstancy. Songs and proverbs, all talk of woman's fickleness. But perhaps you will say, these were all written by men.''Perhaps I shall. Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples in books. Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been in their hands. I will not allow books to prove anything.'
No man, for any considerable period, can wear one face to himself, and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true.
It is an illusion that youth is happy, an illusion of those who have lost it; but the young know they are wretched, for they are full of the truthless ideals which have been instilled into them, and each time they come in contact with the real they are bruised and wounded. It looks as if they were victims of a conspiracy; for the books they read, ideal by the necessity of selection, and the conversation of their elders, who look back upon the past through a rosy haze of forgetfulness, prepare them for an unreal life. They must discover for themselves that all they have read and all they have been told are lies, lies, lies; and each discovery is another nail driven into the body on the cross of life.
'I've got the key to my castle in the air, but whether I can unlock the door remains to be seen,'observed Jo mysteriously.
And there is no greatness where simplicity, goodness, and truth are absent.
He did not care if she was heartless, vicious and vulgar, stupid and grasping, he loved her. He would rather have misery with the one than happiness with the other.
Well I know that thou wouldst have loved me, and the mystery of love is greater than the mystery of death.
Know your own happiness. You want nothing but patienceor give it a more fascinating name, call it hope.
I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son _for many years an only _child_, I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves _my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable_, allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth. What do I not owe you. You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.'
Oh, it's delightful to have ambitions. I'm so glad I have such a lot. And there never seems to be any end to them that's the best of it. Just as soon as you attain to one ambition you see another one glittering higher up still. It does make life so interesting.'
Peace is always beautiful, The myth of heaven indicates peace and night.
I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every body else it must be in my own way.
And yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together nowadays.
What's done can not be undone.
Love Jo all your days, if you choose, but don't let it spoil you, for it's wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can't have the one you want.
There is a momentOh, just before the first kiss, a whispered wordsomething that makes it worth while.
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
It's only because of their stupidity that they're able to be so sure of themselves.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir.
There was a long hard time when I kept far from me the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant of its worth.
Those who restrain desire, do so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained; and the restrainer or reason usurps its place and governs the unwilling.
I don't like workno man doesbut I like what is in the workthe chance to find yourself. Your own realityfor yourself, not for otherswhat no other man can ever know. They can only see the mere show, and never can tell what it really means.
'What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,'returned my companion, bitterly.'The question is, what can you make people believe that you have done.
My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end. It is its own goal. It is its own purpose.
Good-night, my'He stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me.
If it is asserted that civilization is a real advance in the condition of man, and I think that it is, though only the wise improve their advantages, it must be shown that it has produced better dwellings without making them more costly; and the cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.
'A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love her.'
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they shall be. If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would be their worth.
I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together freely and build our castles in the air.
You made me confess the fears that I have. But I will tell you also what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be spurned for another or to leave whatever I have to leave. And I am not afraid to make a mistake, even a great mistake, a lifelong mistake, and perhaps as long as eternity too.
'My mind,'he said,'rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own particular profession, or rather created it, for I am the only one in the world.'
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains, Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend More than cool reason ever comprehends. The lunatic, the lover, and the poet Are of imagination all compact: One sees more devils than vast hell can hold; That is the madman: the lover, all as frantic, Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt: The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling, Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven; And as imagination bodies forth The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name.
Oh, Lizzy. do anything rather than marry without affection.
Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.
Again he said:'Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the happiness you bring.'
There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners till needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping, and the sweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence and shadow behind.
This above all: to thine own self be true; And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Don't laugh at the spinsters, dear girls, for often very tender, tragic romances are hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns, and many silent sacrifices of youth, health, ambition, love itself, make the faded faces beautiful in God's sight. Even the sad, sour sisters should be kindly dealt with, because they have missed the sweetest part of life, if for no other reason.
It is a good rule in life never to apologize. The right sort of people do not want apologies, and the wrong sort take a mean advantage of them.
You use a glass mirror to see your face: you use works of art to see your soul.
There are many humorous things in the world; among them the white man's notion that he is less savage than the other savages.
And when one of them meets with his other half, the actual half of himself, whether he be a lover of youth or a lover of another sort, the pair are lost in an amazement of love and friendship and intimacy, and one will not be out of the other's sight, as I may say, even for a moment: these are the people who pass their whole lives together; yet they could not explain what they desire of one another.
The most terrible thing about it is not that it breaks one's heart hearts are made to be broken but that it turns one's heart to stone.
Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.
If I am occasionally a little over-dressed, I make up for it by being always immensely over-educated.
At the bottom of her heart, however, she was waiting for something to happen. Like shipwrecked sailors, she turned despairing eyes upon the solitude of her life, seeking afar off some white sail in the mists of the horizon. She did not know what this chance would be, what wind would bring it her, towards what shore it would drive her, if it would be a shallop or a three-decker, laden with anguish or full of bliss to the portholes. But each morning, as she awoke, she hoped it would come that day; she listened to every sound, sprang up with a start, wondered that it did not come; then at sunset, always more saddened, she longed for the morrow.
'If a man hasn't what's necessary to make a woman love him, it's his fault, not hers.'
Nobody can tell what I suffer. But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.'
He knows nothing; and he thinks he knows everything. That points clearly to a political career.
'Always. That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last for ever. It is a meaningless word, too. The only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.'
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince, And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.
Our revels now are ended. These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits, and Are melted into air, into thin air: 150 And, like the baseless fabric of this vision, The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great globe itself, Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, 155 Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff As dreams are made on; and our little life Is rounded with a sleep.
He remembered it in this form perhaps he had unconsciously arranged and polished it:'A woman should be able to kiss a man beautifully and romantically without any desire to be either his wife or his mistress.'
A word is dead When it is said, Some say. I say it just Begins to live That day.
It has often and confidently been asserted, that man's origin can never be known: but ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science.
To think with pleasure of his niece's husband having a large ecclesiastical income was one thingto make a Liberal speech was another thing; and it is a narrow mind which can not look at a subject from various points of view.
Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life; Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents'strife.
My meaning simply is, that whatever I have tried to do in life, I have tried with all my heart to do well; that whatever I have devoted myself to, I have devoted myself to completely; that in great aims and in small, I have always been thoroughly in earnest.
Who dares think one thing, and another tell, My heart detests him as the gates of hell.
I knew nothing but shadows, and I thought them real.
'This is nothing,'cried she:'I was only going to say that heaven did not seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke sobbing for joy.
This is my last message to you: in sorrow seek happiness.
O teach me how I should forget to think.
Who could refrain, That had a heart to love, and in that heart Courage to make's love known.
There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they will do for themselves.
My way of joking is to tell the truth. It's the funniest joke in the world.
There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves, we feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession, not the priest, that gives us absolution.
For all evils there are two remediestime and silence.
He wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted all to sparkle and dance in a glorious jubilee. I said his heaven would be only half alive; and he said mine would be drunk: I said I should fall asleep in his; and he said he could not breathe in mine, and began to grow very snappish.
Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.
I love acting. It is so much more real than life.
It is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy; it is disposition alone. Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven days are more than enough for others.
I've been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.'
With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts.
'You are fettered,'said Scrooge, trembling.'Tell me why.''I wear the chain I forged in life,'replied the Ghost.'I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it.
ALICE How do you know that you're mad. CAT To begin with, a dog's not mad. You grant that. ALICE I suppose so. CAT Well then, you see a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.
It is difficult for a woman to define her feelings in language which is chiefly made by men to express theirs.
We must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake, not by mechanical aids, but by an infinite expectation of the dawn, which does not forsake us in our soundest sleep. I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor. It is something to be able to paint a particular picture, or to carve a statue, and so to make a few objects beautiful; but it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere and medium through which we look, which morally we can do. To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts.
I hope you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That would be hypocrisy.
One can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing.
Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.
She is very clever, too clever for a woman. She lacks the indefinable charm of weakness.
At least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.
What's in a name. That which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title.
Come gentle night, come loving black-brow'd night, Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die, Take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night, And pay no worship to the garish sun.
If Nature has made you for a giver, your hands are born open, and so is your heart; and though there may be times when your hands are empty, your heart is always full, and you can give things out of that warm things, kind things, sweet things help and comfort and laughter and sometimes gay, kind laughter is the best help of all.
All is best as they are.'
To be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether't is nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them. To dieto sleep, No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to:'t is a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep.
'I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,'said Darcy,'of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I can not catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.'
She had not known the weight, until she felt the freedom.
To recapitulate then: I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words as _The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty.
and turning round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,'She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.
'If you love me, as you say,'she whispered,'do so that I may be at peace.'
Upon my word, I would think that finances and all the rest of it are an invention of the devil; only that a belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary; men alone are quite capable of every wickedness.
At first people refuse to believe that a strange new thing can be done, then they begin to hope it can be done, then they see it can be donethen it is done and all the world wonders why it was not done centuries ago.
No one who can read, ever looks at a book, even unopened on a shelf, like one who can not.
Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats offthen, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.
She wished at the same time to die and to live in Paris.
So long as we love we serve; so long as we are loved by others, I would almost say that we are indispensable; and no man is useless while he has a friend.
At the age of eleven or thereabouts women acquire a poise and an ability to handle difficult situations which a man, if he is lucky, manages to achieve somewhere in the later seventies.
What greater thing is there for two human souls than to feel that they are joined for lifeto strengthen each other in all labour, to rest on each other in all sorrow, to minister to each other in all pain, to be one with each other in silent unspeakable memories at the moment of the last parting.
How quick come the reasons for approving what we like.
When you will not fly into a passion people know you are stronger than they are, because you are strong enough to hold in your rage, and they are not, and they say stupid things they wish they hadn't said afterward. There's nothing so strong as rage, except what makes you hold it in that's stronger. It's a good thing not to answer your enemies.
I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things, which I dare not confess to my own soul.
BEN WEATHERSTAFF One of the strange things about living in the world is that it is only now and then one is quite sure one is going to live forever and ever and ever. One knows it sometimes when one gets up at the tender solemn dawn-time and goes out and stands alone and throws one's head far back and looks up and up and watches the pale sky slowly changing and flushing and marvelous unknown things happening until the East almost makes one cry out and one's heart stands still at the strange unchanging majesty of the rising of the sunwhich has been happening every morning for thousands and thousands and thousands of years. One knows it then for a moment or so. And one knows it sometimes when one stands by oneself in a wood at sunset and the mysterious deep gold stillness slanting through and under the branches seems to be saying slowly again and again something one can not quite hear, however much one tries. Then sometimes the immense quiet of the dark blue at night with millions of stars waiting and watching makes one sure; and sometimes a sound of far-off music makes it true; and sometimes a look in someone's eyes.
We women, as some one says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, if you ever love at all.'
There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.
My child, the troubles and temptations of your life are beginning and may be many, but you can overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your Heavenly Father as you do that of your earthly one. The more you love and trust Him, the nearer you will feel to Him, and the less you will depend on human power and wisdom. His love and care never tire or change, can never be taken from you, but may become the source of lifelong peace, happiness, and strength. Believe this heartily, and go to God with all your little cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as freely and confidingly as you come to your mother.'
Tom, I hope something happens. I'm restless as the devil and have a horror of getting fat or falling in love and growing domestic.
Pause you who read this, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold, of thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the formation of the first link on one memorable day.
Don't let yourself feel worthless; often through life you will really be at your worst when you seem to think best of yourself; and don't worry about losing your'personality,'as you persist in calling it; at fifteen you had the radiance of early morning, at twenty you will begin to have the melancholy brilliance of the moon, and when you are my age you will give out, as I do, the genial golden warmth of 4 P.M.
They were conquerors, and for that you want only brute forcenothing to boast of, when you have it, since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of others.
Who's the man that says that we're all islands shouting lies to each other across seas of misunderstanding.'
In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta, since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence, so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions. I lay down the book and go to my well for water, and lo. there I meet the servant of the Bramin, priest of Brahma and Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges reading the Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug. I meet his servant come to draw water for his master, and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well. The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges.
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus, and we petty men Walk under his huge legs, and peep about To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
A man of genius makes no mistakes. His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.
It would be mortifying to the feelings of many ladies, could they be made to understand how little the heart of man is affected by what is costly or new in their attire; how little it is biased by the texture of their muslin, and how unsusceptible of peculiar tenderness towards the spotted, the sprigged, the mull, or the jackonet. Woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone. No man will admire her the more, no woman will like her the better for it. Neatness and fashion are enough for the former, and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter.
The language of Friendship is not words, but meanings.
Every generation laughs at the old fashions, but follows religiously the new.
The real loneliness is living among all these kind people who only ask one to pretend.'
All men want, not something to _do with_, but something to _do_, or rather something to _be_.
'If men could see us as we really are, they would be a little amazed; but the cleverest, the acutest men are often under an illusion about women.
The unqualified truth is, that when I loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her simply because I found her irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my sorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be. Once for all; I loved her none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influence in restraining me than if I had devoutly believed her to be human perfection.
You are a story I am a story.
'Watch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never think it is impossible to conquer your fault,'said Mrs. March, drawing the blowzy head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that Jo cried even harder.
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
How puzzling all these changes are. I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to another.
'You gave too much rein to your imagination. Imagination is a good servant, and a bad master. The simplest explanation is always the most likely.'
People over forty can seldom be permanently convinced of anything. At eighteen our convictions are hills from which we look; at forty-five they are caves in which we hide.
'Pierre was right when he said one must believe in the possibility of happiness in order to be happy, and now I do believe in it. Let the dead bury their dead, but while one has life one must live and be happy.'
He who fears he shall suffer, already suffers what he fears.
Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting.
Our wretched species is so made that those who walk on the well-trodden path always throw stones at those who are showing a new road.
Blame it or praise it, there is no denying the wild horse in us.
He wanted to cry quietly but not for himself: for the words, so beautiful and sad, like music.
If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about … like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees.
Beauty to her, as to all who have felt, lay not in the thing, but in what the thing symbolized.
There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody's expense but his own.
A few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window. It had begun to snow again. He watched sleepily the flakes, silver and dark, falling obliquely against the lamplight. The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward. Yes, the newspapers were right: snow was general all over Ireland. It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.
Remember, my friend, that knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.
The lady protests too much, methinks.
The cruellest lies are often told in silence.
She was dazzling alight; it was agony to comprehend her beauty in a glance.
But the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.
The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.
If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will tend._ Every life is many days, day after day. We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves.
All the privilege I claim for my own sex _it is not a very enviable one; you need not covet it_, is that of loving longest, when existence or when hope is gone.'
It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.
It is really a very hard life. Men will not be nice to you if you are not good-looking, and women will not be nice to you if you are.
Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered'Listen,'a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.
Better be without sense, than misapply it as you do.'
'The last hours were certainly very painful,'replied Anne;'but when pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.
It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.
'I see you everywhere, in the stars, in the river; to me you're everything that exists; the reality of everything.
It's hard to love a woman and do anything.
I hate people who are not serious about meals. It is so shallow of them.
I remember having read somewhere, in some strange book, that when the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers.
Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly.
When a woman marries again, it is because she detested her first husband. When a man marries again, it is because he adored his first wife. Women try their luck; men risk theirs.'
One man's ways may be as good as another's, but we all like our own best.

'Harry,'said Mrs. Maylie,'it is because I think so much of warm and sensitive hearts, that I would spare them from being wounded.
3 Jeeves and the Unbidden Guest I'm not absolutely certain of my facts, but I rather fancy it's Shakespeare or, if not, it's some equally brainy bird who says that it's always just when a fellow is feeling particularly braced with things in general that Fate sneaks up behind him with the bit of lead piping.
And I shall go on shining as a brilliantly meaningless figure in a meaningless world.

But smiles and tears are so alike with me, they are neither of them confined to any particular feelings: I often cry when I am happy, and smile when I am sad.'
I always find it more difficult to say the things I mean than the things I don't.'
Have regular hours for work and play, make each day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well. Then youth will be delightful, old age will bring few regrets, and life become a beautiful success, in spite of poverty.'
If we admit that human life can be ruled by reason, the possibility of life is destroyed.
'The reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is sheer terror.
'Oh, it's always the same,'she sighed,'if you want men to behave well to you, you must be beastly to them; if you treat them decently they make you suffer for it.'
I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.'
I'm wearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there: not seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the walls of an aching heart: but really with it, and in it.
She guessed a woman's guess is much more accurate than a man's certainty that he had meant to go from the first, and with Mrs. Hauksbee.
said Cacambo.'Alas.'said Candide,'it is the madness of maintaining that everything is right when it is wrong.'

A man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman. He ought not; he does not.'
_Aside_ So wise so young, they say, do never live long.
I really don't see anything romantic in proposing. It is very romantic to be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal. Why, one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe. Then the excitement is all over. The very essence of romance is uncertainty. If ever I get married, I'll certainly try to forget the fact.
I have always had more dread of a pen, a bottle of ink, and a sheet of paper, than of a sword or pistol.'
'If it wasn't for the mist we could see your home across the bay,'said Gatsby.'You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock.'Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.
Ah, good conversation there's nothing like it, is there. The air of ideas is the only air worth breathing.
There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which can not be touched without emotion.

'Death should take me while I am in the mood,'replied I, with a little of my customary levity.
He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.
I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.
'But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.'
Never did she find anything so difficult as to keep herself from losing her temper when she was suddenly disturbed while absorbed in a book. People who are fond of books know the feeling of irritation which sweeps over them at such a moment. The temptation to be unreasonable and snappish is one not easy to manage.'It makes me feel as if someone had hit me,'Sara had told Ermengarde once in confidence.'And as if I want to hit back. I have to remember things quickly to keep from saying something ill-tempered.'
He soon felt that the realization of his desires gave him no more than a grain of sand out of the mountain of happiness he had expected. It showed him the mistake men make in picturing to themselves happiness as the realization of their desires.
People go on marrying because they can't resist natural forces, although many of them may know perfectly well that they are possibly buying a month's pleasure with a life's discomfort.
For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one thing. The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new ties will be formed about you ties that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly to the home you so adorn the dearest ties that will ever grace and gladden you. O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a happy father's face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you.'
Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.
Misfortunes one can endurethey come from outside, they are accidents. But to suffer for one's own faultsah.there is the sting of life.
Love is a possible strength in an actual weakness.
The sea is everything. It covers seven tenths of the terrestrial globe. Its breath is pure and healthy. It is an immense desert, where man is never lonely, for he feels life stirring on all sides. The sea is only the embodiment of a supernatural and wonderful existence. It is nothing but love and emotion; it is the`Living Infinite,'as one of your poets has said.
This world is but canvas to our imaginations.
Soon after the completion of his college course, his whole nature was kindled into one intense and passionate effervescence of romantic passion. His hour came, the hour that comes only once; his star rose in the horizon, that star that rises so often in vain, to be remembered only as a thing of dreams; and it rose for him in vain. To drop the figure, he saw and won the love of a high-minded and beautiful woman, in one of the northern states, and they were affianced. He returned south to make arrangements for their marriage, when, most unexpectedly, his letters were returned to him by mail, with a short note from her guardian, stating to him that ere this reached him the lady would be the wife of another. Stung to madness, he vainly hoped, as many another has done, to fling the whole thing from his heart by one desperate effort. Too proud to supplicate or seek explanation, he threw himself at once into a whirl of fashionable society, and in a fortnight from the time of the fatal letter was the accepted lover of the reigning belle of the season; and as soon as arrangements could be made, he became the husband of a fine figure, a pair of bright dark eyes, and a hundred thousand dollars; and, of course, everybody thought him a happy fellow. The married couple were enjoying their honeymoon, and entertaining a brilliant circle of friends in their splendid villa, near Lake Pontchartrain, when, one day, a letter was brought to him in _that_ well-remembered writing. It was handed to him while he was in full tide of gay and successful conversation, in a whole room-full of company. He turned deadly pale when he saw the writing, but still preserved his composure, and finished the playful warfare of badinage which he was at the moment carrying on with a lady opposite; and, a short time after, was missed from the circle. In his room, alone, he opened and read the letter, now worse than idle and useless to be read. It was from her, giving a long account of a persecution to which she had been exposed by her guardian's family, to lead her to unite herself with their son: and she related how, for a long time, his letters had ceased to arrive; how she had written time and again, till she became weary and doubtful; how her health had failed under her anxieties, and how, at last, she had discovered the whole fraud which had been practised on them both. The letter ended with expressions of hope and thankfulness, and professions of undying affection, which were more bitter than death to the unhappy young man. He wrote to her immediately:'I have received yours, but too late. I believed all I heard. I was desperate. _I am married_, and all is over. Only forget, it is all that remains for either of us.'And thus ended the whole romance and ideal of life for Augustine St. Clare. But the _real_ remained, the _real_, like the flat, bare, oozy tide-mud, when the blue sparkling wave, with all its company of gliding boats and white-winged ships, its music of oars and chiming waters, has gone down, and there it lies, flat, slimy, bare, exceedingly real. Of course, in a novel, people's hearts break, and they die, and that is the end of it; and in a story this is very convenient. But in real life we do not die when all that makes life bright dies to us.
I am satisfied.
WHITE QUEEN It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards.
Why didn't you tell me there was danger in men-folk. Why didn't you warn me. Ladies know what to fend hands against, because they read novels that tell them of these tricks; but I never had the chance o'learning in that way, and you did not help me.'
They get up early, because they have so much to do, and go to bed early, because they have so little to think about.
I have an idea that the only thing which makes it possible to regard this world we live in without disgust is the beauty which now and then men create out of the chaos. The pictures they paint, the music they compose, the books they write, and the lives they lead. Of all these the richest in beauty is the beautiful life. That is the perfect work of art.'
The only artists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists. Good artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a really great poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating. The worse their rhymes are, the more picturesque they look. The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible. He lives the poetry that he can not write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realize.'
I try all things; I achieve what I can.
It seemed that the only lover she had ever wanted was a lover in a dream.
They were careless people, Tom and Daisythey smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made … I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child.
I want to do something splendid before I go into my castle, something heroic or wonderful that won't be forgotten after I'm dead. I don't know what, but I'm on the watch for it, and mean to astonish you all some day.
Yet, mad am I notand very surely do I not dream.
The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.
He had the appearance of one who has searched for the leak in life's gas-pipe with a lighted candle; of one whom the clenched fist of Fate has smitten beneath the temperamental third waistcoat-button.
In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital thing.
She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas. alas. she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet.
Yes; I can not speak well enough to be unintelligible.'
My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse, to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.
One need not be a chamber to be haunted, One need not be a house; The brain has corridors surpassing Material place.

Among women, the goddesses of the Egyptian, Indian and Greek mythologies, certain Bible characters, especially the Holy Mother; Cleopatra, Penelope; the portraits of Brunhelde and Chriemhilde in the Nibelungen; Oriana, Una, & c.; the modern Consuelo, Walter Scott's Jeanie and Effie Deans, & c. & c. _Yet woman portray'd or outlin'd at her best, or as perfect human mother, does not hitherto, it seems to me, fully appear in literature._ _28_ Note, to-day, an instructive, curious spectacle and conflict. Science, _twin in its fields, of Democracy in its_ Science, testing absolutely all thoughts, all works, has already burst well upon the world a sun, mounting, most illuminating, most glorious surely never again to set. But against it, deeply entrench'd, holding possession, yet remains, _not only through the churches and schools, but by imaginative literature, and unregenerate poetry, _ the fossil theology of the mythic-materialistic, superstitious, untaught and credulous, fable-loving, primitive ages of humanity.
'So,'said Estella,'I must be taken as I have been made. The success is not mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me.'
I'm not sure what I'll do, but well, I want to go places and see people. I want my mind to grow. I want to live where things happen on a big scale.'

The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain.
It is ever so much easier to be good if your clothes are fashionable.
You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.
'Thus with my lips have I denounced you, while my heart, bleeding within me, called you tender names.'It was love lashed by its own self that spoke. It was pride half slain that fluttered in the dust. It was my hunger for your love that raged from the housetop, while my own love, kneeling in silence, prayed your forgiveness.
I also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won.
She was feeling the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.
We mortals, men and women, devour many a disappointment between breakfast and dinner-time; keep back the tears and look a little pale about the lips, and in answer to inquiries say,'Oh, nothing.'Pride helps us; and pride is not a bad thing when it only urges us to hide our own hurtsnot to hurt others.
Droll thing life isthat mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose. The most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourselfthat comes too latea crop of unextinguishable regrets.
'I would prefer not to,'said he.
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.
It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again.
'We can't behave like people in novels, though, can we.'
If there is one person I dislike, it is the man who tries to air his grievances when I wish to air mine.
I love you.
It is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure. I don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.'
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows, Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows, Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine, With sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine.
It made her think that it was curious how much nicer a person looked when he smiled. She had not thought of it before.
HENRY JAMES THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY CHAPTER I Under certain circumstances there are few hours in life more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea.
I know what it is to live entirely for and with what I love best on earth. I hold myself supremely blestblest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's life as fully as he is mine.
Eternity is in love with the productions of time.
There is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which life can not rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes when one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive. This ecstasy, this forgetfulness of living, comes to the artist, caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame; it comes to the soldier, war-mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter; and it came to Buck, leading the pack, sounding the old wolf-cry, straining after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through the moonlight.

She was convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet.
Love, whether newly born, or aroused from a death-like slumber, must always create a sunshine, filling the heart so full of radiance, that it overflows upon the outward world.
CXXX My mistress'eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red, than her lips red: If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. I have seen roses damask'd, red and white, But no such roses see I in her cheeks; And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. I love to hear her speak, yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound: I grant I never saw a goddess go, My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground: And yet by heaven, I think my love as rare, As any she belied with false compare.
There is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love.
Something magical has happened to me, like a dream, when you're frightened, panic-stricken, and all of a sudden you wake up and all the horrors are no more. I have waked up.
It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they can not find it.
Not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life's opportunity misused.
Oh, the terrible struggle that I have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness, or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has for me. How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams.
No man is offended by another man's admiration of the woman he loves; it is the woman only who can make it a torment.'
I never change, except in my affections.
Love, she thought, must come suddenly, with great outbursts and lightnings a hurricane of the skies, which falls upon life, revolutionises it, roots up the will like a leaf, and sweeps the whole heart into the abyss.

Never speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon. Only people who can't get into it do that.
Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.
I am sick to death of cleverness. Everybody is clever nowadays.

The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.
Her pleasure in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges, and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness, that season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read, some attempt at description, or some lines of feeling.
O, here Will I set up my everlasting rest; And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last. Arms, take your last embrace. And, lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing death.

As long as a woman can look ten years younger than her own daughter, she is perfectly satisfied.
But better die than live mechanically a life that is a repetition of repetitions.
If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the'creativetemperament'it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. NoGatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.
Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man's face. It can not be concealed.
Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once more, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the world began. Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself. For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life. God keep thee. Push not off from that isle, thou canst never return.
I say, beware of all enterprises that require new clothes, and not rather a new wearer of clothes.

I've no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in heaven; and if the wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff so low, I shouldn't have thought of it. It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.'

It is not life that's complicated, it's the struggle to guide and control life.
Hope is the thing with feathers That perches in the soul, And sings the tune without the words, And never stops at all, And sweetest in the gale is heard; And sore must be the storm That could abash the little bird That kept so many warm. I've heard it in the chillest land, And on the strangest sea; Yet, never, in extremity, It asked a crumb of me.

Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.
I know that you're selfish, selfish beyond words, and I know that you haven't the nerve of a rabbit, I know you're a liar and a humbug, I know that you're utterly contemptible.

That was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me. But it is the same with any life. Imagine one selected day struck out of it, and think how different its course would have been. Pause you who read this, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold, of thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the formation of the first link on one memorable day.

If children were brought into the world by an act of pure reason alone, would the human race continue to exist. Would not a man rather have so much sympathy with the coming generation as to spare it the burden of existence.

I was something that lay under the sun and felt it, like the pumpkins, and I did not want to be anything more. I was entirely happy. Perhaps we feel like that when we die and become a part of something entire, whether it is sun and air, or goodness and knowledge. At any rate, that is happiness; to be dissolved into something complete and great. When it comes to one, it comes as naturally as sleep.
'I knew,'he continued,'you would do me good in some way, at some time; I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression and smile didnot'_again hestopped_'did not'_he proceeded hastily_'strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.
'He says unloved women have no biographies they have histories.'
Away, and mock the time with fairest show: False face must hide what the false heart doth know.
'Do not give way to useless alarm,'added he;'though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains, Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend More than cool reason ever comprehends.
Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.
I have now been married ten years. I know what it is to live entirely for and with what I love best on earth. I hold myself supremely blestblest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's life as fully as he is mine. No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. I know no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together. To be together is for us to be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company. We talk, I believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and an audible thinking. All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in characterperfect concord is the result.
Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell.
'I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,'said Darcy.'Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.'
A dream, all a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down, but I wish you to know that you inspired it.'
Some of us look for the Way in opium and some in God, some of us in whisky and some in love. It is all the same Way and it leads nowhither.'
THE CURTAIN And the secret garden bloomed and bloomed and every morning revealed new miracles.
'I am like a hungry man who has been given food. He may be cold, and dressed in rags, and ashamed, but he is not unhappy.
It was one of the queer things of life that you saw a person every day for months and were so intimate with him that you could not imagine existence without him; then separation came, and everything went on in the same way, and the companion who had seemed essential proved unnecessary.
Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever. I have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight. A dream, all a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down, but I wish you to know that you inspired it.'
but I never have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall.
He struggled with himself, too. I saw itI heard it. I saw the inconceivable mystery of a soul that knew no restraint, no faith, and no fear, yet struggling blindly with itself.
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.
'How despicably I have acted.'she cried;'I, who have prided myself on my discernment. I, who have valued myself on my abilities. who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust. How humiliating is this discovery. Yet, how just a humiliation. Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.'
It would have been so pointless to kill himself that, even if he had wanted to, the pointlessness would have made him unable.
The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to.
They pressed upon his brain as upon his lips as though they were the vehicle of a vague speech; and between them he felt an unknown and timid pressure, darker than the swoon of sin, softer than sound or odour.
You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever.
I believe in some blending of hope and sunshine sweetening the worst lots. I believe that this life is not all; neither the beginning nor the end. I believe while I tremble; I trust while I weep.'
How it is that animals understand things I do not know, but it is certain that they do understand. Perhaps there is a language which is not made of words and everything in the world understands it. Perhaps there is a soul hidden in everything and it can always speak, without even making a sound, to another soul.
Nor is there anything more remarkable in Socrates than that, old as he was, he found time to make himself taught dancing and playing upon instruments, and thought it time well spent.
Every woman is a rebel, and usually in wild revolt against herself.
If the day and the night are such that you greet them with joy, and life emits a fragrance like flowers and sweet-scented herbs, is more elastic, more starry, more immortal, that is your success. All nature is your congratulation, and you have cause momentarily to bless yourself. The greatest gains and values are farthest from being appreciated. We easily come to doubt if they exist. We soon forget them. They are the highest reality. Perhaps the facts most astounding and most real are never communicated by man to man. The true harvest of my daily life is somewhat as intangible and indescribable as the tints of morning or evening. It is a little star-dust caught, a segment of the rainbow which I have clutched.
So full of artless jealousy is guilt, It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listenedthen the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.
'I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all places are alike to me.
I learned this, at least, by my experiment; that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. He will put some things behind, will pass an invisible boundary; new, universal, and more liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within him; or the old laws be expanded, and interpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense, and he will live with the license of a higher order of beings.
'At first I did not love you, Jude; that I own. When I first knew you I merely wanted you to love me. I did not exactly flirt with you; but that inborn craving which undermines some women's morals almost more than unbridled passionthe craving to attract and captivate, regardless of the injury it may do the manwas in me; and when I found I had caught you, I was frightened. And thenI don't know how it wasI couldn't bear to let you gopossibly to Arabella againand so I got to love you, Jude. But you see, however fondly it ended, it began in the selfish and cruel wish to make your heart ache for me without letting mine ache for you.'
Candide, terrified, amazed, desperate, all bloody, all palpitating, said to himself:'If this is the best of possible worlds, what then are the others.
'Do you remember what Darwin says about music. He claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood.''That's rather a broad idea,'I remarked.'One's ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature,'he answered.
But his soul was mad. Being alone in the wilderness, it had looked within itself, and, by heavens.
Her reputation of reading a great deal hung about her like the cloudy envelope of a goddess in an epic; it was supposed to engender difficult questions and to keep the conversation at a low temperature.
Out of my sight. Thou dost infect mine eyes.
'People are very fond of giving away what they need most themselves. It is what I call the depth of generosity.'
The only people I would care to be with now are artists and people who have suffered: those who know what beauty is, and those who know what sorrow is: nobody else interests me.
So we'll just let things take their course and never be sorry.
You will find as you grow older that the first thing needful to make the world a tolerable place to live in is to recognise the inevitable selfishness of humanity. You demand unselfishness from others, which is a preposterous claim that they should sacrifice their desires to yours. Why should they. When you are reconciled to the fact that each is for himself in the world you will ask less from your fellows. They will not disappoint you, and you will look upon them more charitably. Men seek but one thing in lifetheir pleasure.'
Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once. Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, It seems to me most strange that men should fear, Seeing that death, a necessary end, Will come when it will come.
Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer both in waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams.
O. none, unless this miracle have might, That in black ink my love may still shine bright.
Welcome, O life. I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.
It is too difficult to think nobly when we think for a livelihood.
Bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm to the body; but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind.
She had been forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older: the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.
'When a woman loves you she's not satisfied until she possesses your soul. Because she's weak, she has a rage for domination, and nothing less will satisfy her.
Most true is it that'beauty is in the eye of the gazer.'My master's colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows, deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth, all energy, decision, will, were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite mastered me, that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them in his. I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and strong. He made me love him without looking at me.
'You're a slave, a bound helpless slave to one thing in the world, your imagination.'
The unqualified truth is, that when I loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her simply because I found her irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my sorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be. Once for all; I loved her none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influence in restraining me than if I had devoutly believed her to be human perfection.
_Cal._ Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises, 130 Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not. Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices, That, if I then had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming, 135 The clouds methought would open, and show riches Ready to drop upon me; that, when I waked, I cried to dream again.
And then I looked at the stars, and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to them as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude.
He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was … … One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight.
The beauty or ugliness of a character lay not only in its achievements, but in its aims and impulses; its true history lay, not among things done, but among things willed.
One by one they were all becoming shades. Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age.
I always thirsted for knowledge, I have always been full of questions.
Beware the Ides of March.
I should feel the air move against me, and feel the things I touched, instead of having only to look at them. Iâm sure life is all wrong because it has become much too visualâwe can neither hear nor feel nor understand, we can only see. Iâm sure that is entirely wrong.â âYes, that is true, that is true, â said the Russian.
Actors are so fortunate. They can choose whether they will appear in tragedy or in comedy, whether they will suffer or make merry, laugh or shed tears. But in real life it is different. Most men and women are forced to perform parts for which they have no qualifications. Our Guildensterns play Hamlet for us, and our Hamlets have to jest like Prince Hal. The world is a stage, but the play is badly cast.
What am I to do.
'Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything, even our intellects.
Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time.'
Could there be finer symptoms. Is not general incivility the very essence of love.'
A man always finds it hard to realize that he may have finally lost a woman's love, however badly he may have treated her.
Life does not cease to be funny when people die any more than it ceases to be serious when people laugh.
For love is the desire of the whole, and the pursuit of the whole is called love.
How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full of good men even if there _are_ monsters in it.
It is one of the defects of my character that I can not altogether dislike anyone who makes me laugh.
You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are.'
We live in the flickermay it last as long as the old earth keeps rolling. But darkness was here yesterday.
Art is the most intense mode of Individualism that the world has known.
'Oh, brothers. I don't care for brothers. My elder brother won't die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.'
All our arguing with him would not avail; let him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us allPresbyterians and Pagans alikefor we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending.
If I am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also.
And thus I clothe my naked villainy With odd old endsstol'n forth of holy writ, And seem a saint when most I play the devil.
'I call people rich when they're able to meet the requirements of their imagination.
And beauty is a form of geniusis higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It can not be questioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of those who have it.
No mockery in this world ever sounds to me so hollow as that of being told to _cultivate_ happiness. What does such advice mean. Happiness is not a potato, to be planted in mould, and tilled with manure. Happiness is a glory shining far down upon us out of Heaven. She is a divine dew which the soul, on certain of its summer mornings, feels dropping upon it from the amaranth bloom and golden fruitage of Paradise.
Ay sir, to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.
Everything must be taken into account. If the fact will not fit the theorylet the theory go.'
Thirtythe promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning briefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair.
I had three chairs in my house; one for solitude, two for friendship, three for society.
I am not always good and noble. I am the hero of this story, but I have my off moments.
'I don't care about truth. I want some happiness.'
The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality.
It is foolish to wish for beauty. Sensible people never either desire it for themselves or care about it in others. If the mind be but well cultivated, and the heart well disposed, no one ever cares for the exterior.
She had a great desire for knowledge, but she really preferred almost any source of information to the printed page; she had an immense curiosity about life and was constantly staring and wondering.
'Look at that,'she whispered, and then after a moment:'I'd like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around.'
I wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether Catherine would suffer greatly from his loss: the fear that she would restrains me. And there you see the distinction between our feelings: had he been in my place, and I in his, though I hated him with a hatred that turned my life to gall, I never would have raised a hand against him. You may look incredulous, if you please. I never would have banished him from her society as long as she desired his. The moment her regard ceased, I would have torn his heart out, and drunk his blood. But, till thenif you don't believe me, you don't know metill then, I would have died by inches before I touched a single hair of his head.'
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished, For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
It is the business of the very few to be independent; it is a privilege of the strong. And whoever attempts it, even with the best right, but without being OBLIGED to do so, proves that he is probably not only strong, but also daring beyond measure. He enters into a labyrinth, he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life in itself already brings with it; not the least of which is that no one can see how and where he loses his way, becomes isolated, and is torn piecemeal by some minotaur of conscience. Supposing such a one comes to grief, it is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it, nor sympathize with it. And he can not any longer go back. He can not even go back again to the sympathy of men.
'Knowledge would be fatal. It is the uncertainty that charms one. A mist makes things wonderful.'
Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy's wing.
Call me Ishmael.
Evil indeed is the man who has not one woman to mourn him.
Insensibly he formed the most delightful habit in the world, the habit of reading: he did not know that thus he was providing himself with a refuge from all the distress of life; he did not know either that he was creating for himself an unreal world which would make the real world of every day a source of bitter disappointment.
What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.
The fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew myself no longer. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from my body and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every fibre of my frame.
What a lovely thing a rose is.'He walked past the couch to the open window, and held up the drooping stalk of a moss-rose, looking down at the dainty blend of crimson and green. It was a new phase of his character to me, for I had never before seen him show any keen interest in natural objects.'There is nothing in which deduction is so necessary as in religion,'said he, leaning with his back against the shutters.'It can be built up as an exact science by the reasoner. Our highest assurance of the goodness of Providence seems to me to rest in the flowers. All other things, our powers our desires, our food, are all really necessary for our existence in the first instance. But this rose is an extra. Its smell and its colour are an embellishment of life, not a condition of it. It is only goodness which gives extras, and so I say again that we have much to hope from the flowers.'
It's a pleasant world we live in sir, a very pleasant world. There are bad people in it, Mr Richard, but if there were no bad people, there would be no good lawyers.
'I'll tell you,'said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper,'what real love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiteras I did.'
When you really want love you will find it waiting for you.
The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after work. But it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.
Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee.
I am sure there is Magic in everything, only we have not sense enough to get hold of it and make it do things for uslike electricity and horses and steam.'
It is a curious subject of observation and inquiry, whether hatred and love be not the same thing at bottom. Each, in its utmost development, supposes a high degree of intimacy and heart-knowledge; each renders one individual dependent for the food of his affections and spiritual life upon another; each leaves the passionate lover, or the no less passionate hater, forlorn and desolate by the withdrawal of his subject.
I sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in strait-waistcoats.
I could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to pain sometimes.
Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once.
Life is so constructed, that the event does not, can not, will not, match the expectation.
Time brought resignation, and a melancholy sweeter than common joy.
Chapter L I have an idea that some men are born out of their due place. Accident has cast them amid certain surroundings, but they have always a nostalgia for a home they know not. They are strangers in their birthplace, and the leafy lanes they have known from childhood or the populous streets in which they have played, remain but a place of passage. They may spend their whole lives aliens among their kindred and remain aloof among the only scenes they have ever known. Perhaps it is this sense of strangeness that sends men far and wide in the search for something permanent, to which they may attach themselves. Perhaps some deep-rooted atavism urges the wanderer back to lands which his ancestors left in the dim beginnings of history.
'Do you believe,'said Candide,'that men have always massacred each other as they do to-day, that they have always been liars, cheats, traitors, ingrates, brigands, idiots, thieves, scoundrels, gluttons, drunkards, misers, envious, ambitious, bloody-minded, calumniators, debauchees, fanatics, hypocrites, and fools.''Do you believe,'said Martin,'that hawks have always eaten pigeons when they have found them.'
Mother says as th'two worst things as can happen to a child is never to have his own wayor always to have it.
It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life.
I know I must conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he can not care much for me. For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him.
Instead of chopping yourself down to fit the world, chop the world down to fit yourself.
They spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly.'Oh, comply.'it said.'Think of his misery; think of his dangerlook at his state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the recklessness following on despairsoothe him; save him; love him; tell him you love him and will be his. Who in the world cares for _you_. or who will be injured by what you do.'Still indomitable was thereply'_I_ care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself. I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man. I will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not madas I am now. Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they shall be. If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would be their worth. They have a worthso I have always believed; and if I can not believe it now, it is because I am insanequite insane: with my veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its throbs. Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot.'
I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw.
These, then, are my last words to you: Be not afraid of life. Believe that life _is_ worth living, and your belief will help create the fact.
And he could not tell why the struggle was worth while, why he had determined to use to the utmost himself and his heritage from the personalities he had passed. He stretched out his arms to the crystalline, radiant sky.'I know myself,'he cried,'but that is all.'
'I have only twenty acres,'replied the old man;'I and my children cultivate them; our labour preserves us from three great evils weariness, vice, and want.'
Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts.
How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams.
She had no tolerance for scenes which were not of her own making, and it was odious to her that her husband should make a show of himself before the servants.
Why should we build our happiness on the opinions of others, when we can find it in our own hearts.
In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place.
No one but a woman can help a man when he is in trouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him.'
Love is the most selfish of all the passions.
'Well, what I mean is that I shouldn't mind being a bride at a wedding, if I could be one without having a husband.
The past could always be annihilated. Regret, denial, or forgetfulness could do that. But the future was inevitable.
Much more surprising things can happen to anyone who, when a disagreeable or discouraged thought comes into his mind, just has the sense to remember in time and push it out by putting in an agreeable determinedly courageous one. Two things can not be in one place.
Chapter 13 There are no conditions to which a man can not become used, especially if he sees that all around him are living in the same way.
Simple, generous goodness is the best capital to found the business of this life upon. It lasts when fame and money fail, and is the only riches we can take out of this world with us.
You know I hate, detest, and can't bear a lie, not because I am straighter than the rest of us, but simply because it appalls me. There is a taint of death, a flavour of mortality in lieswhich is exactly what I hate and detest in the worldwhat I want to forget.
I'm not to be imposed upon by fine words; I can see what actions mean.
The quality of mercy is not strained: it droppeth, as the gentle rain from heaven, Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd; It blesses him that gives, and him that takes:'T is mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes The throned monarch better than his crown: His scepter shows the force of temporal power, The attribute to awe and majesty, Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings; But mercy is above this sceptered sway; It is enthroned in the hearts of kings; It is an attribute to God himself; And earthly power doth then show likest God's, When mercy seasons justice.
Youth is like having a big plate of candy. Sentimentalists think they want to be in the pure, simple state they were in before they ate the candy. They don't. They just want the fun of eating it all over again.
ROSALIND: Those days are over. I have to be won all over again every time you see me.
Hence the saying: One may _know_ how to conquer without being able to _do_ it.
In the little world in which children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice.
But especially he loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights, listening to the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest, reading signs and sounds as man may read a book, and seeking for the mysterious something that calledcalled, waking or sleeping, at all times, for him to come.
The unexpected has happened so continually in my life that it has ceased to deserve the name.
'Man,'I cried,'how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom.
O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd. She was a vixen when she went to school, And though she be but little, she is fierce.
I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance. Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone. The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound. Fortunately in England, at any rate, education produces no effect whatsoever.
Live all you can; it's a mistake not to. It doesn't so much matter what you do in particular, so long as you have your life. If you haven't had that what _have_ you had.
one's duty is to feel what is great, cherish the beautiful, and not accept all the conventions of society with the ignominy that it imposes upon us.'
But love is blind, and lovers can not see The pretty follies that themselves commit.
Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly, disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love her.

One of these masters, Thayumanavar, has left us the following challenging poem: You can control a mad elephant; You can shut the mouth of the bear and the tiger; You can ride a lion; You can play with the cobra; By alchemy you can eke out your livelihood; You can wander through the universe incognito; You can make vassals of the gods; You can be ever youthful; You can walk on water and live in fire; But control of the mind is better and more difficult.
It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries.
Long enough have you dream'd contemptible dreams, Now I wash the gum from your eyes, You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your life.
All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril.
Love is fragile she was thinking but perhaps the pieces are saved, the things that hovered on lips, that might have been said. The new love words, the tendernesses learned, are treasured up for the next lover.
Not knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never feel certain of not losing himself again.
I fancy that the true explanation is this: It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack of style. They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give us an impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that. Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play. Or rather we are both. We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls us.
She wanted to exist only as a conscious flower, prolonging and preserving itself.
Things without all remedy Should be without regard: what's done is done.
From the first day I met her, she was the only woman to me. Every day of that voyage I loved her more, and many a time since have I kneeled down in the darkness of the night watch and kissed the deck of that ship because I knew her dear feet had trod it. She was never engaged to me. She treated me as fairly as ever a woman treated a man. I have no complaint to make. It was all love on my side, and all good comradeship and friendship on hers. When we parted she was a free woman, but I could never again be a free man.
'Do you remember what you said to me once. That you could help me only by loving me. Well you did love me for a moment; and it helped me. It has always helped me.
Every morning was a cheerful invitation to make my life of equal simplicity, and I may say innocence, with Nature herself.
We changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far to go back, and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and the world lay spread before me.
We may brave human laws, but we can not resist natural ones.'
The evil that men do lives after them, The good is oft interred with their bones; So let it be with Caesar.
THE RAVEN Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of, forgotten lore, While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
And it is you, spiritwith will and energy, and virtue and puritythat I want: not alone your brittle frame.
Every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room, put on her scribbling suit, and'fall into a vortex', as she expressed it, writing away at her novel with all her heart and soul, for till that was finished she could find no peace.
_, or at best'froglike,'mandeikagati _Footnote: Like the frog: staccato._ _I do everything to be'difficultly understood'myself._ and one should be heartily grateful for the good will to some refinement of interpretation.
Mistress Mary always felt that however many years she lived she should never forget that first morning when her garden began to grow.
_Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa._ Oh. it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should read and what one shouldn't. More than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldn't read.
Majesty: when a stupid man is doing something he is ashamed of, he always declares that it is his duty.
'As a rule,'said Holmes,'the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify.
She was incomprehensible, for, in her, soul and spirit were one the beauty of her body was the essence of her soul. She was that unity sought for by philosophers through many centuries. In this outdoor waiting room of winds and stars she had been sitting for a hundred years, at peace in the contemplation of herself._ _It became known to her, at length, that she was to be born again.
The secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming.
And certainly, the mistakes that we male and female mortals make when we have our own way might fairly raise some wonder that we are so fond of it.
Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form.
For love is a flower that grows in any soil, works its sweet miracles undaunted by autumn frost or winter snow, blooming fair and fragrant all the year, and blessing those who give and those who receive.
Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue.
They're talking about things of which they don't have the slightest understanding, anyway. It's only because of their stupidity that they're able to be so sure of themselves.
There is a wisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces. And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.
Improvement makes straight roads, but the crooked roads without Improvement are roads of Genius.
This suited the young lady better than twilight confidences, tender pressures of the hand, and eloquent glances of the eye, for with Jo, brain developed earlier than heart, and she preferred imaginary heroes to real ones, because when tired of them, the former could be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter were less manageable.
Doctoring her seemed to her as absurd as putting together the pieces of a broken vase. Her heart was broken. Why would they try to cure her with pills and powders.
Victory depends on you.
_Aside._ Come what come may, Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
Do you not think that there are things which you can not understand, and yet which are; that some people see things that others can not. But there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men's eyes, because they know or think they know some things which other men have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain.
You would not enjoy Nietzsche, sir. He is fundamentally unsound.'
Well, she succeeded somewhat, for, though sympathy can't alter facts, it can help to make them more bearable.
_Reads._ _Doubt thou the stars are fire, Doubt that the sun doth move, Doubt truth to be a liar, But never doubt I love.
The error all women commit. Why can't you women love us, faults and all. Why do you place us on monstrous pedestals. We have all feet of clay, women as well as men; but when we men love women, we love them knowing their weaknesses, their follies, their imperfections, love them all the more, it may be, for that reason. It is not the perfect, but the imperfect, who have need of love. It is when we are wounded by our own hands, or by the hands of others, that love should come to cure uselse what use is love at all. All sins, except a sin against itself, Love should forgive. All lives, save loveless lives, true Love should pardon. A man's love is like that. It is wider, larger, more human than a woman's. Women think that they are making ideals of men. What they are making of us are false idols merely. You made your false idol of me, and I had not the courage to come down, show you my wounds, tell you my weaknesses. I was afraid that I might lose your love, as I have lost it now.
And what sort of lives do these people, who pose as being moral, lead themselves. My dear fellow, you forget that we are in the native land of the hypocrite.'
Life did not stand still and it was necessary to live.
Matthew, much to his own surprise, was enjoying himself. Like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it.
It may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her character.
'Sir,'said Captain Smollett,'with no intention to take offence, I deny your right to put words into my mouth.
All censorships exist to prevent anyone from challenging current conceptions and existing institutions. All progress is initiated by challenging current concepts, and executed by supplanting existing institutions. Consequently the first condition of progress is the removal of censorships.
INTO MY OWN One of my wishes is that those dark trees, So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze, Were not, as'twere, the merest mask of gloom, But stretched away unto the edge of doom. I should not be withheld but that some day Into their vastness I should steal away, Fearless of ever finding open land, Or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand. I do not see why I shoulde'er turn back, Or those should not set forth upon my track To overtake me, who should miss me here And long to know if still I held them dear. They would not find me changed from him they knew- Only more sure of all I thought was true.
There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat, And we must take the current when it serves, Or lose our ventures.
She was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words.
I take the imputation in good part, as a compliment to the just delineation of my female characters; and though I am bound to attribute much of the severity of my censors to this suspicion, I make no effort to refute it, because, in my own mind, I am satisfied that if a book is a good one, it is so whatever the sex of the author may be. All novels are, or should be, written for both men and women to read, and I am at a loss to conceive how a man should permit himself to write anything that would be really disgraceful to a woman, or why a woman should be censured for writing anything that would be proper and becoming for a man.
The supreme question about a work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring.
'I can't tell you,'repeated Amory,'just how wonderful she is. I don't want you to know. I don't want any one to know.'
'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare say,'returned the nephew.'Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it.'
There is nothing to opinions, they may be beautiful or ugly, smart or foolish, everyone can support them or discard them.
Everywhere we go and move on and change, something's lost something's left behind. You can't ever quite repeat anything, and I've been so yours, here'He held her passionately near, discerning far beyond any criticism of her sentiment, a wise grasping of the minute, if only an indulgence of her desire to cry Gloria the idler, caresser of her own dreams, extracting poignancy from the memorable things of life and youth.
I see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were it but free, it would soar cloud-high.
In the first place, his startling likeness to Catherine connected him fearfully with her. That, however, which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my imagination, is actually the least: for what is not connected with her to me. and what does not recall her. I can not look down to this floor, but her features are shaped in the flags. In every cloud, in every treefilling the air at night, and caught by glimpses in every object by dayI am surrounded with her image. The most ordinary faces of men and womenmy own featuresmock me with a resemblance. The entire world is a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist, and that I have lost her.
Was he an animal if music could captivate him so. It seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been yearning for.
Come, you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, And fill me, from the crown to the toe, top-full Of direst cruelty. make thick my blood, Stop up th'access and passage to remorse, That no compunctious visitings of nature Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between Th'effect and it. Come to my woman's breasts, And take my milk for gall, yourmurd'ring ministers, Wherever in your sightless substances You wait on nature's mischief. Come, thick night, And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell That my keen knife see not the wound it makes, Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark To cry,'Hold, hold.'
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet, Though to itself, it only live and die, But if that flower with base infection meet, The basest weed outbraves his dignity: For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds; Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.
The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing can not be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him.
'God is the same everywhere.
We walked to meet each other up to the time of our love, and then we have been irresistibly drifting in different directions.
One farmer says to me,'You can not live on vegetable food solely, for it furnishes nothing to make bones with;'and so he religiously devotes a part of his day to supplying his system with the raw material of bones; walking all the while he talks behind his oxen, which, with vegetable-made bones, jerk him and his lumbering plough along in spite of every obstacle.
O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
You must suffer me to go my own dark way.
He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God.
If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us.
Therefore, thought I, what God says is best, indeed is best, though all the men in the world are against it.
You have never loved me as I love younevernever. Yours is not a passionate heartyour heart does not burn in a flame. You are, upon the whole, a sort of fay, or spritenot a woman.'
No tear dropped over that pillow; in such straits as these, the heart has no tears to give, it drops only blood, bleeding itself away in silence.
Know, then, thyself, presume not God to scan; The proper study of mankind is man. Placed on this isthmus of a middle state, A being darkly wise, and rudely great: With too much knowledge for the sceptic side, With too much weakness for the stoic's pride, He hangs between; in doubt to act, or rest; In doubt to deem himself a god, or beast; In doubt his mind or body to prefer; Born but to die, and reasoning but to err; Alike in ignorance, his reason such, Whether he thinks too little, or too much: Chaos of thought and passion, all confused; Still by himself abused, or disabused; Created half to rise, and half to fall; Great lord of all things, yet a prey to all; Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurled: The glory, jest, and riddle of the world. Go, wondrous creature. mount where science guides, Go, measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides; Instruct the planets in what orbs to run, Correct old time, and regulate the sun; Go, soar with Plato to th'empyreal sphere, To the first good, first perfect, and first fair; Or tread the mazy round his followers trod, And quitting sense call imitating God; As Eastern priests in giddy circles run, And turn their heads to imitate the sun. Go, teach Eternal Wisdom how to rule Then drop into thyself, and be a fool.
Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.
For mine own good, All causes shall give way: I am in blood Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as goo'er.
One loves ultimately one's desires, not the thing desired.
I find I am much prouder of the victory I obtain over myself, when, in the very ardour of dispute, I make myself submit to my adversary's force of reason, than I am pleased with the victory I obtain over him through his weakness.
Moments of their secret life together burst like stars upon his memory.
Sometimes I shrink from your knowing what I have felt for you, and sometimes I am distressed that all of it you never will know.
His habit of reading isolated him: it became such a need that after being in company for some time he grew tired and restless; he was vain of the wider knowledge he had acquired from the perusal of so many books, his mind was alert, and he had not the skill to hide his contempt for his companions'stupidity. They complained that he was conceited; and, since he excelled only in matters which to them were unimportant, they asked satirically what he had to be conceited about. He was developing a sense of humour, and found that he had a knack of saying bitter things, which caught people on the raw; he said them because they amused him, hardly realising how much they hurt, and was much offended when he found that his victims regarded him with active dislike. The humiliations he suffered when first he went to school had caused in him a shrinking from his fellows which he could never entirely overcome; he remained shy and silent. But though he did everything to alienate the sympathy of other boys he longed with all his heart for the popularity which to some was so easily accorded. These from his distance he admired extravagantly; and though he was inclined to be more sarcastic with them than with others, though he made little jokes at their expense, he would have given anything to change places with them.
What would you not have accomplished if you had been free.''Possibly nothing at all; the overflow of my brain would probably, in a state of freedom, have evaporated in a thousand follies; misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect. Compression is needed to explode gunpowder. Captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus; and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is producedfrom electricity, lightning, from lightning, illumination.'
Now I will believe That there are unicorns; that in Arabia There is one tree, the phœnix'throne; one phœnix At this hour reigning there.
What, drawn, and talk of peace. I hate the word As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee: Have at thee, coward.
CHAPTER IX As we grow older and realize more clearly the limitations of human happiness, we come to see that the only real and abiding pleasure in life is to give pleasure to other people.
That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in literature. The man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one.
But what we call our despair is often only the painful eagerness of unfed hope.
'Somehow, something always happens,'she cried,'just before things get to the very worst. It is as if the Magic did it. If I could only just remember that always. The worst thing never QUITE comes.'
I saidor something in me said for me, and in spite of me'Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness. I am strangely glad to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my homemy only home.'
I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love, If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles. You will hardly know who I am or what I mean, But I shall be good health to you nevertheless, And filter and fibre your blood. Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged, Missing me one place search another, I stop somewhere waiting for you.
'There are some upon this earth of yours,'returned the Spirit,'who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.'
I am somewhat exhausted; I wonder how a battery feels when it pours electricity into a non-conductor.
I don't know how to be silent when my heart is speaking.
Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.
She was of the stuff of which great men's mothers are made. She was indispensable to high generation, hated at tea parties, feared in shops, and loved at crises.
Sometimes since I've been in the garden I've looked up through the trees at the sky and I have had a strange feeling of being happy as if something were pushing and drawing in my chest and making me breathe fast. Magic is always pushing and drawing and making things out of nothing. Everything is made out of Magic, leaves and trees, flowers and birds, badgers and foxes and squirrels and people. So it must be all around us. In this gardenin all the places.
That is rather difficult, but the merit in all things consists in the difficulty.
A written word is the choicest of relics. It is something at once more intimate with us and more universal than any other work of art. It is the work of art nearest to life itself. It may be translated into every language, and not only be read but actually breathed from all human lips; not be represented on canvas or in marble only, but be carved out of the breath of life itself.
Love is anterior to life, Posterior to death, Initial of creation, and The exponent of breath.
It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another.
O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife.
Let men tremble to win the hand of woman, unless they win along with it the utmost passion of her heart.
That is the sole consideration which can make me endure the whelp: I despise him for himself, and hate him for the memories he revives.
Think not, is my eleventh commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfthSo here goes again.
my heart is set, as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman. I have no thought, no view, no hope in life, beyond her; and if you oppose me in this great stake, you take my peace and happiness in your hands, and cast them to the wind.
To learn to see to accustom the eye to calmness, to patience, and to allow things to come up to it; to defer judgment, and to acquire the habit of approaching and grasping an individual case from all sides. This is the first preparatory schooling of intellectuality. One must not respond immediately to a stimulus; one must acquire a command of the obstructing and isolating instincts.
If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away. It is not important that he should mature as soon as an apple-tree or an oak. Shall he turn his spring into summer.
The soul is a terrible reality. It can be bought, and sold, and bartered away.
I swear I only want to hear about you, to know what you've been doing. It's a hundred years since we've met it may be another hundred before we meet again.'
This hobble of being alive is rather serious, don't you think so.'
Was it the infinite sadness of her eyes that drew him or the mirror of himself that he found in the gorgeous clarity of her mind.
You are part of my existence, part of myself. You have been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, the rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been in every prospect I have ever seen since, on the river, on the sails of the ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the darkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become acquainted with.
'Was it necessary to tell me that you wanted nothing in the world but me.'The corners of his mouth drooped peevishly.'Oh, my dear, it's rather hard to take quite literally the things a man says when he's in love with you.''Didn't you mean them.''At the moment.'
Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin.
Indeed, no woman should ever be quite accurate about her age. It looks so calculating.
_Alb._ The weight of this sad time we must obey; Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say. The oldest hath borne most: we that are young Shall never see so much, nor live so long.
But you must learn to forgive a man when he's in love. He's always a nuisance.
The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit at their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all should liveundisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands. Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they aremy art, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray's good lookswe shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.'
_In a very patronising manner._ My dear fellow, the truth isn't quite the sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl. What extraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman.
He was alone. He was unheeded, happy and near to the wild heart of life. He was alone and young and wilful and wildhearted, alone amid a waste of wild air and brackish waters and the seaharvest of shells and tangle and veiled grey sunlight and gayclad lightclad figures of children and girls and voices childish and girlish in the air.
There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men.'
Whatd'you suppose I care if I'm a gentleman or not. If I were a gentleman I shouldn't waste my time with a vulgar slut like you.
Even extreme grief may ultimately vent itself in violencebut more generally takes the form of apathy.
'That is because you are a philosopher, for philosophy begins in wonder, and Iris is the child of Thaumas.
The fourth member of the party, however, was too excited to be genuinely happy.
Men have called me mad; but the question is not yet settled, whether madness is or is not the loftiest intelligencewhether much that is gloriouswhether all that is profounddoes not spring from disease of thoughtfrom moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect. They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night. In their gray visions they obtain glimpses of eternity, and thrill, in awakening, to find that they have been upon the verge of the great secret. In snatches, they learn something of the wisdom which is of good, and more of the mere knowledge which is of evil. They penetrate, however, rudderless or compassless into the vast ocean of the'light ineffable,'and again, like the adventures of the Nubian geographer,'agressi sunt mare tenebrarum, quid in eo esset exploraturi.'
I have laughed, in bitterness and agony of heart, at the contrast between what I seem and what I am.
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.
M. Emanuel was not a man to write books; but I have heard him lavish, with careless, unconscious prodigality, such mental wealth as books seldom boast; his mind was indeed my library, and whenever it was opened to me, I entered bliss.
God surely did not create us and cause us to live with the sole end of wishing always to die. I believe in my heart we were intended to prize life and enjoy it so long as we retain it. Existence never was originally meant to be that useless, blank, pale, slow-trailing thing it often becomes to many, and is becoming to me among the rest.
Human life must be some kind of mistake. The truth of this will be sufficiently obvious if we only remember that man is a compound of needs and necessities hard to satisfy; and that even when they are satisfied, all he obtains is a state of painlessness, where nothing remains to him but abandonment to boredom. This is direct proof that existence has no real value in itself; for what is boredom but the feeling of the emptiness of life. If life the craving for which is the very essence of our being were possessed of any positive intrinsic value, there would be no such thing as boredom at all: mere existence would satisfy us in itself, and we should want for nothing.
He says, no varnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you put on, the more the grain will express itself.
I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.
He could not be mistaken. There were no other eyes like those in the world. There was only one creature in the world that could concentrate for him all the brightness and meaning of life. It was she. It was Kitty.
The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.
So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlightwatching over nothing.
Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove: O, no. it is an ever-fixed mark, That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark, Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come; Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
It is no use trying to sum people up.
A lake is the landscape's most beautiful and expressive feature. It is earth's eye; looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his own nature.
I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.
God made food, the devil the cooks.
Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.
And then:'I enjoy the spring more than the autumn now. One does, I think, as one gets older.'
If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.
'There can be no disparity in marriage, like unsuitability of mind and purpose.'
No man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so.
And as each and all of them were warmed without by the sun, so each had a private little sun for her soul to bask in; some dream, some affection, some hobby, at least some remote and distant hope which, though perhaps starving to nothing, still lived on, as hopes will.
'My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.'
'I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices. I never take any notice of what common people say, and I never interfere with what charming people do. If a personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality selects is absolutely delightful to me.
Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeplyI was casually sorry, and then I forgot.
The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.
The logic can not be refuted, but someone who wants to live will not resist it.
And,'added she musingly,'the thing that irks me most is this shattered prison, after all. I'm tired of being enclosed here. I'm wearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there: not seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the walls of an aching heart: but really with it, and in it.
'All I think of ever is that I love you,'she wailed.
He wanted to be where no one would know who he was. He wanted to escape from himself.
At any rate, that is happiness; to be dissolved into something complete and great. When it comes to one, it comes as naturally as sleep.
If you were coming in the fall, I'd brush the summer by With half a smile and half a spurn, As housewives do a fly. If I could see you in a year, I'd wind the months in balls, And put them each in separate drawers, Until their time befalls.
But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face.
In his younger days a man dreams of possessing the heart of the woman whom he loves; later, the feeling that he possesses the heart of a woman may be enough to make him fall in love with her.
Doctor, you don't know what it is to doubt everything, even yourself. No, you don't; you couldn't with eyebrows like yours.'
It echoed loudly within him because he was hollow at the core.
'What the deuce is it to me.'he interrupted impatiently;'you say that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.'
It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.
Perhaps there is a language which is not made of words and everything in the world understands it.
'If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable.''Because you are not fit to go there,'I answered.'All sinners would be miserable in heaven.'
Marry, sir,'t is an ill cook that can not lick his own fingers; therefore he that can not lick his fingers goes not with me.
A rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does; a hypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good faith. All falsehood is a mask; and however well made the mask may be, with a little attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true face.
In beauty of face no maiden ever equaled her. It was the radiance of an opium-dream an airy and spirit-lifting vision more wildly divine than the phantasies which hovered about the slumbering souls of the daughters of Delos.
The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher.
In this world one has to be cunning and cruel.'
Two of these fellows you Must know and own; this thing of darkness I 275 Acknowledge mine.
Yet experience has shown, and a true philosophy will always show, that a vast, perhaps the larger portion of truth, arises from the seemingly irrelevant.
There are two things that men should never weary of, goodness and humility; we get none too much of them in this rough world among cold, proud people; but Mr. Henderland had their very speech upon his tongue.
So we grew together, Like to a double cherry, seeming parted, But yet a union in partition, Two lovely berries moulded on one stem; So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart; Two of the first, like coats in heraldry, Due but to one, and crowned with one crest.
But scandal is gossip made tedious by morality.
'Isabel's written in a foreign tongue.
and read out from his book,'Rule Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.'
Man, do not pride yourself on superiority to the animals; they are without sin, and you, with your greatness, defile the earth by your appearance on it, and leave the traces of your foulness after youalas, it is true of almost every one of us.

When the body escaped mutilation, seldom did the heart go to the grave unscarred.
She was so evidently the victim of the civilization which had produced her, that the links of her bracelet seemed like manacles chaining her to her fate.
Bathsheba loved Troy in the way that only self-reliant women love when they abandon their self-reliance. When a strong woman recklessly throws away her strength she is worse than a weak woman who has never had any strength to throw away. One source of her inadequacy is the novelty of the occasion. She has never had practice in making the best of such a condition. Weakness is doubly weak by being new.
And that taught me you can't have _any_thing, you can't have anything at _all_. Because desire just cheats you. It's like a sunbeam skipping here and there about a room. It stops and gilds some inconsequential object, and we poor fools try to grasp it but when we do the sunbeam moves on to something else, and you've got the inconsequential part, but the glitter that made you want it is gone'He broke off uneasily.
A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it leaves out the one country at which Humanity is always landing. And when Humanity lands there, it looks out, and, seeing a better country, sets sail. Progress is the realisation of Utopias.
But I always liked side‐paths, little dark back‐alleys behind the main roadthere one finds adventures and surprises, and precious metal in the dirt.
Let us a little permit Nature to take her own way; she better understands her own affairs than we.
I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you; kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy accent.
'I wish I had no heart, it aches so,'sighed Meg, after a pause.
What business had I to think so much of one that never thought of me.
The final mystery is oneself. When one has weighed the sun in the balance, and measured the steps of the moon, and mapped out the seven heavens star by star, there still remains oneself. Who can calculate the orbit of his own soul.
'What have the wenches to do.
The places that we have known belong now only to the little world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. None of them was ever more than a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; remembrance of a particular form is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.
She said she knew we were safe with you, and always would be, because once, when she asked you to, you'd given up the thing you most wanted.'Archer received this strange communication in silence. His eyes remained unseeingly fixed on the thronged sunlit square below the window. At length he said in a low voice:'She never asked me.'
What else is Wisdom.
If one doesn't talk about a thing, it has never happened. It is simply expression, as Harry says, that gives reality to things.
Only connect the prose and the passion, and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no longer.
'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,'said the Cat.
The Night Shadows A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it. Something of the awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read but a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead, my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life's end. In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them.
Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly.
He reassured me by his manner as well as his words when he said:'Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which I am here, it is you who would laugh. I have learned not to think little of any one's belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried to keep an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that make one doubt if they be mad or sane.'
Women are constantly trying to commit suicide for love, but generally they take care not to succeed.
'I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone's away. There's something very sensuous about itoverripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.'
When we are unhurried and wise, we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence, that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality.
Every man being born free and his own master, no-one, under any pretext whatsoever, can make any man subject without his consent. To decide that the son of a slave is born a slave is to decide that he is not born a man.
Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.
Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance.
Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death. Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance. Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air. Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being. In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is not me.
But I like talking to a brick wallit's the only thing in the world that never contradicts me.
Never did she find anything so difficult as to keep herself from losing her temper when she was suddenly disturbed while absorbed in a book. People who are fond of books know the feeling of irritation which sweeps over them at such a moment. The temptation to be unreasonable and snappish is one not easy to manage.
As one grows weaker one is less susceptible to suffering. There is less hurt because there is less to hurt.
Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.
I _cannot_ live without my life. I _cannot_ live without my soul.'
I have wrestled with death. It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine. It takes place in an impalpable greyness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around, without spectators, without clamour, without glory, without the great desire of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly atmosphere of tepid scepticism, without much belief in your own right, and still less in that of your adversary.
You can not, sir, take from me anything that I will more willingly part withal, except my life, except my life, except my life.
She said to Anthony one day:'How I feel is that if I wanted anything I'd take it. That's what I've always thought all my life. But it happens that I want you, and so I just haven't room for any other desires.'
We can have in life but one great experience at best, and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible.'
They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat's shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.
XXIX When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes I all alone beweep my outcast state, And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, And look upon myself, and curse my fate, Wishing me like to one more rich in hope, Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd, Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope, With what I most enjoy contented least; Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising, Haply I think on thee, and then my state, Like to the lark at break of day arising From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate; For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
Out, damned spot. out, I say.
O brave new world, That has such people in't.
